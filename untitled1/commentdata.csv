He claims to care about students individually but doesn't. He makes tests more difficult to bring down class average if your class does too well. He is a great lecturer but is very rehearsed. Lectures are clear but very fast paced (he's aware of this). Standard is to record lecture and then take notes outside of class (2-3 hours per lecture).,1.0
"I came into the class as a Senior with a 4.0 GPA and this class was horrible. Despite studying close to 40 hours per exam and going to office hours every week, my test average was about a C+ and I ended with an A- in the course (.3 away from an A). No matter how much you study, if you dont conquer his exam style questions then you wont get an A.",1.0
"Brad is a true gem. He goes extremely in-depth during his lectures, and make sure we participate with our peers to succeed. Midterms make up 40%, the final makes up 20% (not necessarily a cumulative final), and everything else makes up 40%, so it's easy to get free points. Brad knows MCB is a tough class, and he tries to make it easier for us.",1.0
"Brad is an entertaining lecturer, but his lectures are a direct summary of the textbook without any extra insight. He's totally rehearsed the same lecture ""performance"" that he's given for the last fifteen years. The guy is fake. In personal interactions with him I realized it was an act and he couldn't care less about me as an individual student",0.0
"Definitely one of my favorite professors at UIUC so far. Great guy, explains things clearly and really cares about students learning the material. Exams have some tough questions, but he does that to teach you to think critically rather than just memorize things. Wish he taught more courses here!",1.0
I love Brad so much. Literally cannot describe it to you. Such a great guy and rewards his students for putting in the effort. Also a Biology advisor so you can get to know his personally should you choose to do so. Has high expectations but the class is structured so well that all of his requirements are absolutely justified.,1.0
"This professor knows what hes talking about. He teaches students in a way that can be understood no matter their biology background. Not only are his lectures easy to follow along with, but also hes available for office hours. My advice is to fit office hours into your schedule weekly. Do NOT be afraid to ask questions.",1.0
"Brad is an excellent professor. He's not only an expert on the material but also knows how to communicate it effectively. He's a very caring guy and will always make time to help people out (even if it's not about biology). Still, MCB 150 is a very difficult class: go to office hours, pay attention, and study every day if you want to do well.",1.0
Great Guy. Definitely go to his office hours,1.0
"I thought the lectures were very interesting and that the in class questions were very relevant. The exams were very specific and therefore difficult, but overall if you pay attention in lecture and discussion, it's an easy A with a generous curve of the class.",1.0
"The first half of the class I couldn't stand Brad, and then after exam 2, he became my fave professor ever. Hands down one of the most caring professors I've had. This class is HARD but he gives you all the resources you need to succeed, you just have to give yourself enough time to study it. Attend class, record the lectures, & make concept maps!",1.0
"Brad is one of the best professors I've had at the university! His lectures are very engaging, and he cares deeply about all of his students. Make sure to use all the resources he gives you in order to do well! Textbook reading and practice exams are a must.",1.0
"Professor Mehrtens is one of the best Professors I have ever had. Although I took this course online in the summer, he still made it seem as if we were in class and was very clear in all aspects. I learned SO much from this class. Although it is difficult, he truly makes you think hard on questions and makes you connect topics together.",1.0
"Brad is a good professor, but his tests are hard even when youve studied for 12+ hours. I definitely recommend taking all the practice tests you can to get used to the question types. I failed the first two exams and still ended with a B- in the class because he has an adjusted grading scale. Be ready to study!",1.0
"Great professor! He holds office hours which is very helpful, if you pay attention in class and attend office hours every other week, you will enjoy this class rather than stressing about it.",1.0
Brad is an amazing professor. The class is difficult but he makes lectures interesting.,1.0
He is definitely the best mentor I have ever met.,1.0
This course was by no means easy  you will have to work for you grade. The tests are definitely something to get used to. Lots of applications so make sure you understand the material thoroughly. I highly suggest you attend TA office hours (Shafi is AMAZEBALLS) and Brads office hours.,1.0
"Really tough, but best teacher of all time.",1.0
"
                      Brad is the best professor at UIUC. He actually cares about how you, and knows everything about the class that he's teaching. The tests are very hard but if you study a lot they are manageable. Do not skip lecture or else you wont do well

Having Susan for both accy201 and 302. She is a good lecturer and good at explaining definitions and math problems (tho she sometimes was off the track) But the only issue is that she forced you to do a random presentation during the class and you have to participate in order to get points from that.,1.0
"Horrible. Make one mistake on the exams, you get the whole section wrong. The total online quizzes had a class average of 66%. She gives you only 15 minutes to answer 5 tricky questions, and you can't skip or go back. It's ""you know it, or you don't."" Your best bet is to attend the TA discussions and form your own studying group!",0.0
"Curtis is disorganized. Forgets to show up to the first lecture of the semester because she is ""preparing for class"". Tricky pop quizzes and won't provide answers to homework questions. Quizzes should be given after we learn the material not before. Take somewhere else.",0.0
"Curtis gets a bad rep because she really doesn't make learning accounting fun. This class will destroy your gpa if you don't teach yourself the material and practice. I review a lot, used at the textbook a few times, but make sure you practice the PRACTICE EXAMS AND CLASS ACTIVITIES. The class isn't bad-- Susan's relentless off-tangent talking is",1.0
"Knows her stuff but isn't always the best at showing it. Often goes off on tangents for up to twenty minutes, but is able to explain topics thoroughly when focused. Pre-quizzes were the hardest part of the class, so make sure you study beforehand. Class activities help a lot with studying so do them. Gives extra credit towards end of semester.",1.0
"Susan is definitely not the best professor if you didn't take accounting in high school. The textbooks are expensive and useless, the lecture notebook is probably the best thing to get even though it is optional. Be prepared to work, go to office hours, and study every day if you didn't take accounting in high school.",0.0
"She only teaches 20% of the time, but she does it really well. I did all the recommended practice problems, went to class, took notes, and did several practice exams before midterms and got an A+ in class. To do well in tests you have to understand accounting. This is where the practice problems and lectures helped me the most.",1.0
feel really bad for this course,0.0
"Prof Curtis is such a nice and lively person but I just cannot learn from her. The class has minimal structure, there are literally no resources to use on your own except the notes you take in class. Textbook doesn't help at all because it doesn't demonstrate any of the math problems, which is like all she tests on. Tests don't match lecture at all",0.0
"Susan is a hard person to hate. Her energy and theatrics borderline on obnoxious, but you kind of just admire that part of her. She's really passionate about accounting, and will do everything possible to get you to understand the material (including singing, dancing, and rapping).",1.0
"Susan Curtis tells a lot of stories during lecture, which isn't  necessarily a bad thing, but it distracts from actually getting students to understand material. Online Mini-Tests are given, and you never know if you're getting questions wrong because you're completely wrong or because of calculator rounding errors. It doesn't show the right answer",0.0
"Very much a weed-out class. The professor allocates time poorly, often going off on tangents more appropriate for office hours than during a lecture where direct class material should be covered. Discussion sessions are the real chance to learn, and I am noticing the holes in my foundation while taking 202. Concepts are simple, delivery is weak.",0.0
"If you want help, go find TAs. The professor only go through stuff on PPT, which are already posted on Compass. Things are easy but really need practice. The class is really ""optional"" as long as you attend her ""extra credit"" sections to get the points. Her ""extra credit"" means mandatory attendance.",1.0
"Dr. Curtis is an amiable personality, who engages with the students. I only wish that the way she graded was no so heavy on the midterms and that her lectures were more in sink with exam content.",1.0
"Curtis's lectures are funny and entertaining but she spends SO much time talking about unnecessary things. Everything she covers is online. The exams are easy and the final is optional. I made the mistake of buying the textsbooks, the only one your will use is are the lecture note books, never even opened the other two.",0.0
Probably the easiest accy class in the department. I only went to class when she announced there are extra credit opportunity and studied all the materials myself at home. It was an easy A if you go through the past exam and make sure you know how to prepare all the financial statements.  And do go to lecture during the Halloween!,1.0
She is funny. Amazing lecturer only because her lecture is kind of a relax for me. Only thing I learnt from her is just debits on the left and credits on he right. Be really excite about her costumes during Halloween as well. The course changed a lot after I took it. She added pop quizzes so not sure about the class material right now.,1.0
"Curtis does a good job teaching a challenging class. Fail one exam, you fail the class. The generic rubric is 50% for Exam 1 and 50% for Exam 2. Curtis posts slides online that contain what is taught in lecture. I would recommend discussion as the TA's are very helpful. She does provide a 40%, 40%, 20% (optional points) grading option too.",1.0
"Only two midterms throughout the semester (Spring 2016) worth 200 points each. No other way to gain points. Fail one exam and you fail the entire course. Nice person, but horrible professor and has an even worse system of grading. Take at community college if you don't want to risk plumeting your GPA.",0.0
"
                      This class definitely is not easy. Considered the ""weed out"" class for students wanting to study Accounting. If you put in the work and go to her office hours though it is very possible to get an A. Work hard from the beginning if you want to do well.

Dont take him unless you have too. Nice guy but makes his exams unnecessarily hard - makes them for the BEST students in the class. I consider myself a pretty hardworking student and I dedicated hours to this class. Ended up with a B- and honestly proud of that.,0.0
"Although Hummel is a nice guy, he is not a very good lecturer. He doesn't explain concepts well, and when he's doing practice problems he doesn't explain it well either. If anything, I learn more in discussion than lecture.",0.0
Dont be stupid and miss lecture. He gives out test questions in lecture. His tests arent bad at all if u do the work in his class. He honestly has a bad rep cuz people dont want to study. Hes a nice professor. And YES he is TRICKY TOM but if u do the practice tests U CAN CONQUER THIS BEAST.,1.0
"Good lecturer. Course notes/booklet is very concise and teaches you chemistry well. Exams require studying and practice, but are very fair and representative of HW and lecture material. However, the curves also really suck on them, as anything about 85% and above has virtually no curve, while you need a total score in the 90s to recieve an A.",1.0
"Hummel is an amazing lecturer. The class is pretty fast-paced but he is always willing to meet with students outside of office hours. Tests can be hard to do super well on because of tricky wording, but he gives you everything you need to do well. The class is unnecessarily difficult but if you put in the work it's very possible to do well.",1.0
"Nice and interesting Prof though making tricking multiple choice exams. Even if you know everything you may still get an unpleasant grade in exams. He scales exams with some normal-distribution-like ways so if you score a 20 you get bumped to somewhere near 50 or 60, but if you score like a 88 or 91 there's very little curve.",1.0
"Professor Hummel legit made me like chemistry. I struggled in my high school chemistry classes and hated the subject because of my awful teachers. He was different, taught with enthusiasm and managed to fit so much material in 50 minute lectures without making it feel rushed. Still requires a lot of work, and remember to do every HW assignments.",1.0
TRICKY TOM BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE TRICKIEST TESTS POSSIBLE!!!,0.0
"He moves through the material quickly, but will explain most things clearly. He gives a lot of practice exams, and if you do those and the practice problems in the book, you can do well on the exams.",1.0
"Hummel lives up to his name Tricky Tom, but he's not as bad as most people say. Everything in the class is easy except for the tests. The tests are written specifically to make you believe you have the right answer, but in reality you don't. Go to lecture every day because he covers a lot of material the TA's don't.",1.0
"I really enjoyed Professor Hummel. He was a fair teacher in terms of laying out what was expected in his class. Lectures are very interesting. This class was a challenge, but I was in AP Chem so be prepared to work hard.",1.0
"""Tricky Tom"" is known for his tough exams but they are not impossible. If you don't get something that went on in lecture get help at the CLC, his office hours, or your TA's office hours. All his exams are scaled which helps a lot. Homework is worth a lot in the end so as long as you do that you shouldn't do that bad. GO TO LECTURE, handouts book>",1.0
"Professor Hummel is actually a pretty good teacher especially one on one. Go to office hours even if you only have one question. Honestly, I don't think the material is all that difficult, but the exam questions can be unreasonably hard. You need to go to every single lecture and discussion if you want to do well in this class. Study hard.",1.0
Classes are interesting with experiments and jokes. Clear about what will be tested. Tests are easy as long as you are clear about the concepts (knowing why instead of only understanding the formulas and calculations). Answers questions super clearly if you go to him after class. Rated poorly only because people who don't study much suffers.,1.0
"Thought Tom was rude and just an overall poor professor. Tom was definitely the worst professor I had during all my years at Illinois. Wouldn't recommend Tom to anyone, he's just a nightmare to say the least. I regret every moment I spent in that class. If I could go back I definitely would have taken the class with any other professor except Tom.",0.0
Decent professor. exists very well. has not phased out of class. always there to hand out money (so make sure to answer questions).,1.0
"He provided lots of help to students including answering e-mails at any time, providing past exams... But his tests are little bit hard. Need to study hard.",1.0
"From what I heard about other chem 102 professors, Hummel is definitely a solid choice. He goes over example problems consistently in lecture and has cool demos. Although there is a fair amount of work for the class, he's good at teaching it!",1.0
"Honestly, it wasn't bad. Hourly exams are same difficulty levels as past hourly exams. so get them done ahead of time. Also, do all homework questions (including recommended ones). Do homework after lecture. don't slack off.",1.0
"
                      Very test heavy class, which is very unfair  considering his tests are both tricky as well as low on time.  If chemistry is a weak spot for you, try to take 101 first.  When you get to this class, make sure you take a couple hours out of your week to just revise, this class will kick your ass if you don't put in work.

"Javid hands out treats for correct answers in class, it kept students like me engaged in the lecture. He makes funny jokes and narrate anecdotes, they kept the mood of the classroom lively and entertaining.  Lectures were very thorough given the fact that there were so much material to cover in a short amount of time.",1.0
By far my favorite professor yet. I really hate to see him leave UIUC  because I was hoping to sign up for his calc II class again. Everything in the class was pretty much perfect and made calculus very enjoyable.,1.0
"The biggest advantage to Validashti's class is his tests. Unlike the horror stories I hear from classmates about their tests, the tests are very fair and straightforward. Take notes at lectures and do the practice tests that he sends you and you should get at least a B. People with AP credit will still find this course as a nice refresher.",1.0
"Validashti is the man. He's the funniest professor I've had and his jokes are on point. However, I'm not a great math student and I felt calc was my hardest freshman course. He teaches at a really fast pace, and be prepared to learn.",1.0

"He's really a great professor who is able to connect with students. He has made my first semester much less harder than it needed to be because his tests and quizzes were straight forward and not overly difficult like other professors teaching the same class.

"A very cool professor who teaches perfectly in his lectures. This is a very test-heavy class. He's very organized and wants you to succeed given that you put in the effort.

He was a great lecturer who made the points clear and the lectures funny with occasional jokes. Would definately reccomend",1.0
"Murphy is absolutely an amazing professor not because of how he teaches in the lectures but because he posts all the lecture notes on the internet. Besides, preparing yourself with the past quizzes and past exams before the tests and there is no way you can't get an A because all the problems are directly drew from the past with slightly changes.",1.0
One of the best Math Calculus teachers I have Ever had. He does go fast but all you need to do to Ace the class is repeatedly to his past quizzes and exams until you get all problems and you are GUARANTEED to Ace the exams,1.0
"Bob Murphy is an awesome teacher! He works at a very fast pace though, so you have to be prepared to write notes quickly and re-read them for understanding after class. He is generous with office hours and will stay after to help you if you need it. Get to know him because he's great to go to for help. 10/10 recommend his class. I learned a ton!!!",1.0
"Murphy is not a good lecturer. Moves too quickly and the problems covered in class are mere childs play compared to our tests and quizzes. The textbook is also pretty difficult to understand. Lectures need to be drastically improved. The tests and quizzes are 2x hard as the homework and discussion problems. Wanna pass? Ditch lecture, use YouTube.",0.0
"While Professor Murphy may be incredibly smart, that does not define him as a professor. The grading in the class is 80% tests, 20% quizzes.

"Bob Murphy is not only the pinnacle of the mathematical mind. He is also perhaps the most superb human being mankind has available. From his chalk saturated T-shirts, to his affinity to guzzle water mid lecture. There is currently no doubt in my mind or the collective opinion of the UIUC student body that Bob Murphy is an immortal calculus deity.",1.0
Easily one of the hardest math classes I've ever taken. The course is aimed at Engineering and Math majors which implies that it is tough to begin with. The homework is very tedious and is not nearly as hard as the quiz and test questions. Best way to prepare for those are by looking at his old tests and quizzes. Class is hard to even pass.,1.0
"Professor Murphy is great. He is very knowledgeable about his material which makes it easy to understand during lecture. His exams are very difficult but he provides you with past quizzes and tests that you can use to practice. If you want an A, you definitely need to put in the work.",1.0
"Best Math professor I've ever had. In high school I always got an C- on Math, but Murphy's course gives me an A and helps me regain my confidence. True the average is 60%, but that's because those who never study get 0 out of 100. In fact, most can get 85+ (even 100) on every test. Attending lectures & doing old test will ensure you at least an A-",1.0
"Murphy is a great professor. He is exemplary at giving other methods of solving problems besides the book, and is very concise and clear on his explanations.

You have around 7 homework assignments a week that will each take approximately 30 minutes. Homework is worth 20% of your grade and takes up more time than it's worth.

Easily the worst professor I've ever had. Her lecture videos are not helpful when it comes to the homework assignments and quizzes at all.

There are no advantages of using a basic calculator vs a scientific calculator. Doesn't reply to emails. Doesn't even teach in lecture. Lots of extra credit",0.0
"I'm not sure why she is an unpopular professor generally. I thought that she put exactly what she said would be on the quizzes and tests on the quizzes and tests with few surprises. She also hit us with random extra credit to inflate everyone's grades, which no one dislikes. She is good, I recommend, but there is a lot of busy work.",1.0
"The class would have been fine without being required to use those awful, basic calculators. One little mistake typing into your calculator and you have to restart from the beginning! I do not even think she has office hours. Oh well, at least she is becoming better compared to her previous semesters. The final was not difficult.",0.0

All material learned in this class is very outdated and inefficient. She doesn't let her students use anything more than a five dollar calculator let alone excel.

"One of the easiest classes I have ever taken. Lectures are non-mandatory, but it's good to go just in case one of the three pop quizzes shows up. 500 word writing assignment. 3 random quizzes. and 3 Exams. Exams are the easiest thing ever. Just go to the Question/Answer Session the night before, and you'll be fine. Only 1 Quiz between each exam.",1.0
"Professor Altaner leads a pretty interesting class with awesome videos and examples. There are a couple tests which are more challenging and you need to put in more time then you think.

One of the tougher classes I have taken. Dyer is a fine professor and is really like your average college professor. The tests are pretty tough but that was the worst part about the class everything else is pretty manageable.,1.0
The class was outlined at the beginning as to what was expected. Dyer provided videos before each week which clarified everything that he went over in lecture. A lot of this class is teaching yourself outside of class so find a group of friends and it's an easy A.,1.0
"Some tips to be successful in this course: 1. Using Chegg while doing your homework 2. Make sure you understand the exam of previous semesters 3. Just ignore the professor and learn by yourself, it will be easy if you follow his lecture videos online 4. This course is not very tough as long as you are smart.",0.0
Nice guy but terrible professor. His lectures are often just him repeating what is covered in his online pre-lectures videos. The online homework is just awful because it doesn't take the best score and the problems often ask about things that aren't covered in class. Tests are very difficult and you will probably need to teach yourself everything.,0.0
BAD PROFESSOR.... TEST DIFFICULTY VARIES A LOT EACH SEMESTER,0.0
This class is SO hard. Do not take it on campus if you are not going to be a finance major. We have pre-lecture videos that Dyer makes and they ultimately never make sense as someone who has never taken a finance class before. Exams arent curved and are decently difficult. UIUC needs to re-evaluate having this as a business core requirement.,0.0
"I think the biggest problem is that the professor does not pace the course very well. The first few weeks classes were canceled a lot and we have 50 or 0min lecture+50min discussion per week and we only went through 1-2 chapters, but still we had a major test and a group project. Now we'r going 2 chapters a week. I hope he could balance it out.",0.0
"Took this online & this class was hard. No extra credit for the online class, but it is easier because you don't have to go to class. Homework assignments due Fri., lecture ""quizzes"" due Tues., 2 online quizzes, 2 group projects (not bad if you get a smart group), & 2 midterms (not cumulative). If you can do well on the exams, no final. Good luck.",1.0
Sitting in lecture right now thinking about how terrible of a teacher this man is.,0.0
"Dyer is a genuinely nice person, but not an effective teacher. You will see when doing the homework how much he leaves out of lecture. And because the homework doesn't take the highest attempt, grades suffer. Much of the material is self-taught from the textbook, and the general consensus is that the TA's for this course are consistently unhelpful.",0.0
"His homework is a freaking nightmare. You will lose points easily, and once you lose points, you will never have the chance to get full score in your homework. The home work counts on average, and it is really time consuming. The class is useless, and the professor is hilarious.",0.0
"Dyer as a professor is fine. His tests and assignments are straightforward, though you don't learn much in lecture. The pre-flight videos and previous exams are the way to learn in this class. He's a very nice guy though. You can get an A as long as you do those things, though I didn't learn how to study until after the first exam.",1.0
Definitely not a good professor. Pre Lecture videos are fine but you really need to learn on your own. In class he just makes jokes and doesn't really teach.,0.0
"Lectures and videos are somewhat helpful, but they go over the same material, leaving them pretty redundant. Also, exams are way more difficult than the lecture/homework material.",0.0

Just do as many past exams as possible to succeed in the class. (especially if you do not read, conception is mostly drawn from couple of previous exams)",0.0
"Very jolly guy. He doesn't teach during lecture, lecture basically exists to test i clicker questions, not to explain anything. If you learn how to use the calculator you can answer any test question by clicking a few buttons. Its a doable A for anyone, just look at his old exams, 80 percent or more of the questions will be from old exams.",1.0
Fin 221 was a mostly self taught class for me. Classes weren't very helpful and are self driven. The midterms are also challenging. Would take another professor if you can.,0.0

                      I may have an unpopular opinion about Dyer, but I thought he did a great job explaining things in class. As long as you come to class actually ready to learn and pay attention every single time, the material is not difficult. However he has a ton of material to get through in this class, so he can't spoon feed every problem to you. Great guy.

"CS 101 is generally many people's first CS class ever, and in my opinion, it could be taught more effectively. The attitude I got from Gambill is that ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"".

"Class is an easy A. All the assignments and MPs are spoonfed with directions. The professor makes lectures fun with humor. The content was clear to me, but I could see that others were confused because he used sarcasm a lot, and they didn't realize it. I highly recommend!",1.0
"Great class and teacher, but the projects were a little hard.",1.0
"He's a great guy and good at answering questions; he's funny in a nerdy kind of way (he taught recursion with Dr. Seuss). But I just couldn't stay awake in his lectures. I learned the most when I read the book on my own. The class was pretty easy, but it took a bit of work. You can check your grade on the MPs before you submit them, which is nice.",1.0
"Really GOOD and nice Professor, and his class is easy, and very easy to get an A, or even A+, so choose his class!",1.0
"Good teacher overall, difficult class. He tries to make it fun with jokes. Sometimes he can go a little fast in lecture (def go to lecture). Discussions were helpful at times, depending on what we were on. TAs help a lot on MPs so don't hesitate to go. The only book I would def get, besides the lecture notes book, is the VBA book.",1.0

"Gambill is OK. (I've never been to office hours so maybe he's more helpful there) He tries to make the class fun by making jokes and rambling during lecture, but in reality that just makes it more confusing. Like the others say, go to lab - that's where you'll do code and be able to ask questions. I regret not taking labs seriously enough",1.0
This class is beyond easy.  Gambill is also always willing to help.  Great teacher.,1.0

                      Great Instructor. You can tell he is bored with and simply dislikes the material he is teaching but still does his best to teach us what he can.

Professor Stepanov was so far the best stats professors I have had at this university. He genuinely cares about students learning the material. He makes lectures fun and interesting!

"I personally like his lectures for STAT 400/410 but not that much for STAT 420. I liked the class, he is still a great lecturer, it's just a matter of efficiency. I just feel like homework that uses a lot of R should be submitted online. It's much more easy to read then printing them out.",1.0
"Most of the time during the course is in poor efficiency. The most stupid activity he likes is tossing a coin rather than instruct us knowledge.

I'm continuing my with my major!",1.0

"9000/10 the absolute best professor that I've ever had in my life. Ever. I had him for CHEM 202 and CHEM 204. Although it may seem like you shouldn't have taken the class if/when you don't get great grades, DeCoste challenges you to think in ways no other class you ever take will which will benefit you more than you think later on in life.",1.0
"Don Decoste is an absolute legend. If I could give more than five stars, I would. Thats not to say this is an easy class. Its very hard, but thats because he believes in the value of teaching skills like problem solving instead of memorizing random facts. Lectures are always engaging, informative, and very entertaining. 10/10 would take again!",1.0
Go to his office hours so he knows your name. He really wants to help people. Don't worry about looking stupid or anything. His class is hard and the grades reflect that but the final is a lot easier than all of the unit tests so take that into account before dropping,1.0
"Dr. DeCoste explains everything so well and clearly. There is a great amount of work for this class, but if you know to how study smart and hard, you can succeed. Lectures aren't mandatory, but they're totally worth going to. Don't just read the textbook and watch the videos as if you have to, make sure you understand the material thoroughly.",1.0
"He's a very good lecturer. The tests are kind of hard but he curves the hell out of them, so it's fine",1.0
Amazing lectures!! He really knows what he's talking about. He's funny at times and really makes sure we're understanding the material.,1.0
I love him.,1.0
"Go to office hours, do all the homework provided and the practice tests. The grade is based primarily on exams, which test your ability to solve a lot of difficult problems relatively quickly. Knowing Decoste's methods help, and he works through problems during office hours. Take notes during lecture as he goes over problems he expects you to know.",1.0
"Dr. DeCoste is fine. Everyone makes him out to be some sort of chemistry education guru, but he is mediocre in my opinion. He's much much better than many other professors, but that is because of how bad all the other chemistry professors are not because of how good he is.",0.0
Dr. DeCoste is a great professor and he gives clear lectures. Tests are not so hard and he curves a lot so the average should be around 85 or so. He is patient on answering students' questions during office hours and he really makes his student learn a lot from his instruction.,1.0
"Great explanations in class. Lots of material to go through, but he still takes the time to answer student questions and do demos at the end of most lectures. He has a dad's sense of humor (go figure) and genuinely cares about his students as if they were his own kids. Great professor to have, real pleasure to be in his class. Watch the videos!",1.0
"Prof. DeCoste is amazing, he clearly knows what hes doing and always willing to help. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!! Do not fall behind in this class. If you do, say goodbye to your GPA.

"DeCoste prepares his students for challenging material and critical thinking; he deserves his role as an education specialist. He is a perfect example of firm yet fair; his tests are challenging and make you relate concepts in nearly every way possible. At the same time, he is very caring and approachable. He's an outstanding undergrad instructor.",1.0
"Decoste is a great professor and super helpful in office hours. Pay attention in class and learn to use his methods, because that's the only way you'll survive his tests. He can speak quickly sometimes, but don't be afraid to ask questions because he's really nice.",1.0
One of the best professors in the department. Read the textbook and study the challenge problems he assigns because those are similar to the level of difficulty as his test. Online quizzes are hard so work together with friends on them.,1.0

                      Decoste is a really great professor! He does fun experiments & cares for his students, so if you're struggling, talk to him. However, I wouldn't recommend taking this unless you have a solid chem background.  I had taken chem my sophomore year of hs and it's not enough for you to pass this class. If you're a ChemE, try the other sequence of classes

Prof. DiIanni is one of my favorite professors on this campus! I had him for 102 and then chose to take him again for 302. He's really great at explaining and is very approachable. You can tell he has a passion for teaching and economics. I wish I could take more classes with him!!,1.0
"Isaac is a great professor, I really enjoyed his lectures! Really cool guy go to office hours and I recommend getting the workbook for his class, super helpful!",1.0
Amazing professor. Lectures clearly explain important concepts. Exams are very straight forward and based on completely on content reviewed in lectures or through online quizzes. Skip Vasquez and take Dilanni if you're a business major and actually need an adequate foundation in econ for upper-level classes.,1.0
"Dilanni is a great econ professor. Attendance was not mandatory for lectures but, you will not understand the material in discussions or during exams if you don't go. The optional workbook is an absolute lifesaver and definitely worth the money. The workbook has three practice exams for each test and are very similar to the ones he'll give you.",1.0
"DiIanni is awesome. He makes the material very easy to understand and provides tons of examples. As long as you attend lectures and do the practice problems, you'll be fine. I have heard for this class, though, Vazquez is much much easier but DiIanni is a better teacher. I would definitely take this class with him again.",1.0
Easy class! Exams are simple if you retake the practice quizzes and buy the optional workbook (almost all the test questions come from these two sources). DiIanni is very knowledgeable and truly cares about whether his students understand the material or not. Lectures are interesting and his real-world examples help so much.,1.0
Best Economics professor I've ever had. He explains concepts in such a crystal-clear way and is fun to talk to outside of class is well! The exams are tough but the quizzes are super easy (answers are online). 10/10 would take again.,1.0
"A wonderful person and even better professor. This class was so enjoyable not only because of the material, but the way in which it was delivered. You really can't go wrong with DiIanni.",1.0
"Best dressed professor on campus. Very relevant material, even though he's often outspoken. Very calm and well-prepared. Knows how to deal with a lot of nonsense.",1.0
You don't have to work too hard for an A in the class. Go to lectures and take notes because his tests are based on lecture. He has an optional workbook that contains past exams which are very similar every time. Don't count on them being the same every time but I'd say half of the questions are used from previous midterms/exams.,1.0
He's just awesome and very inspirational. Highly recommended if you want to learn.,1.0
"Econ-302 with him is neither the hardest nor the easiest class that I have taken. Professor Dianni is an excellent teacher and he is very knowledgeable about economic issues. He is also very approachable to students, but he has very strong opinions on economic issues, opinions with which some students might disagree.",1.0
Very approachable. Gives a different insight into economic thinking than most professors offer. Challenges and expands your own thinking.,1.0
"Diianni is a great professor and clearly a great guy. He knows so much about the world of Economics and is great at giving real life examples to explain the material taught in class. The class, however, is quite difficult. The exams are similar to the previous exams, but a few questions tripped me up. The final exam my semester was extremely hard.",1.0
"ECON 102 was fairly easy, if you buy the workbook and do the old exams then the actual ones are very similar. You can tell that DiIanni is very passionate about the subject, however lectures could get a little boring. Basically as long as you do the work book then you should get an A, don't bother getting the actual textbook",1.0
"There's 3 midterms and a final. DiIanni is super chill, so you can skip any (or all) of the midterms, and the weight of that exam will be put on your final. He also gives past exams and how to do math problems in his workbook, so you don't really need to go to class (but graphs aren't provided). He offers a good amount of extra credit too!",1.0
"He was an OK lecturer, I guess success is based on the TA. Lecture material kind of matched the exam,  but I was blindsided a lot.",1.0
"I thought his lectures drug on and on. While he certainly is brilliant, he has a tendency to over-explain simple topics to the point of confusing. The flip-side is that he loves to help students during office hours. A little pompous, but overall a good guy. Avoid him at the sub-400 level; take him for 400-level courses. He's much better there.",1.0
"Professor DiIanni is a gifted lecturer and knowledgeable on many economic topics. He explains concepts and answers questions clearly and effectively. ECON 102 is a breeze so long as you review the previous years' exam solutions, which are readily available in your course packet. His impeccable wardrobe is also a plus.",1.0

                      Great professor lots of freedom of attendance, exams, quizzes, and discussions. Not boring at all so focusing won't be a problem. Should pass the class with an A or B anything less is just piss poor effort.

Solomon was a great professor. He was super engaging and entertaining. He laid out course expectations clearly in the required workbook and made it easy to succeed. I would highly recommend taking a class taught by him if you have the chance!,1.0
"Solomon gives amazing and hilarious lectures. There are pop quizzes that account for attendance, but sometimes he literally tells you the answers. This class is definitely not an easy A because you have to put minimal amount of work in, but once you do it's like a piece of cake. Exams are based on memorization; Quizlet is your best friend.",1.0
I took this class thinking it would be interesting and it was but Soloman gives A LOT of busy work. You buy a workbook where you have homework assignments you have to type out and print to turn in. It was definitely not as easy as a gen ed as I hoped it would be. The tests are all memorization but you can easily look up quizletts for them.,1.0
"A nice course overall, no final exam, sample test questions can be found online. The lecture is not really helpful, just make you sleepy, but you don't want to skip the class because he takes attendance. An A is desirable if you work hard before midterm.",1.0
"He is a great guy. By the time I'm writing this review, I haven't finished the class yet but the way he is made me do this review. Easy class, do the quizzes and you'll be fine. He's not a tough grader. He accepts late work only if you present your excuses! I'll chose him as my instructor for any class any day!",1.0
"It's very obvious that he's been doing this for a while. His lectures are so cool and in-depth; I've been learning mythology since grade school, and he taught me so much in this class that I'd never even heard about. Go to the lectures. He doesn't post them online, and they're interesting besides that.",1.0
"This class was a cake walk. Please take it if you get the chance, all of the tests are on quizlet and super easy to study for. I never paid attention in lecture and got an A. definitely worth the $100 for the textbooks. If you can, ask a friend who took the class before to give you their homework.",1.0

Most of the homework assignments are online, but I lost a good amount of points during the discussion quizzes because I didn't do the reading. If you do the work, you'll get an A.",1.0
"Overall, easy class, just google flashcards for it and study it to ace the exams. 3 non-cumulative exams & no final. Really passionate and somewhat eccentric professor. Discussion is mandatory and there's weekly assignments that feel like busy work. The workbook is basically a study guide.",1.0
"Great and interesting class from an awesome professor. Tests are very easy (matching, true/false, vocab) and homework is very short. Highly recommended.",1.0

CLCV 115 was so easy, as long as you do the assignments (3 a week, each take about 20min) and show up to half the classes you will pass no problem. There are no tests for this class and most of the time Jon just talks about random Roman/Greek history but he's fun to listen to.",1.0

It got a little too close for me by the end of the semester because I missed some homework.

"I had Prof. Keane for TAM 445. Subject matter wasn't his area of expertise; he taught straight from the book. Lectures were confusing because the material was new to him, but the homeworks were easy and few (4 or 5 total), and take-home midterm and take-home final were a piece of cake. Class was fun because he told great stories about Australia!",1.0
Lectures were just looking at worked examples. Class itself is hard and the professor isn't very nice. Many people got zero on quizzes and he should have spent more time working through examples in lecture instead of looking at worked examples. Went to the other lecturer after a few weeks. On his way out.,0.0
"I have him for TAM 335 and can honestly say he's my favorite engineering professor I have had in my 4 years here. He is subtly funny and does tend to go on tangents but lectures are actually enjoyable and helpful to go to. He provides so many resources to help students succeed on Compass, along w a very helpful lecture workbook. He rocks!",1.0
He told people he did not want to teach this course because it is approaching his retirement. Kinda sad students are not treated fairly. Lectures are taught with slides.,0.0
"All he does is point at a bunch of unit vectors throughout the course. Very confusing to see so much written on one slide with him just pointing at stuff. Half the class stopped showing up after a few lectures. Quizzes and final exam were pretty fair, no complaints on that. I basically taught myself the course, excluding a few trips to Office hours",0.0
"Very funny! Hard project given to our group currently, but I feel he relieves a lot of the pressure on me. He may not know all the information you look for, but he is always free to talk with. It is great that I can always visit him with ideas and get input rather than have all my ideas shot down like other advisors would.",1.0
Took tam 335 and it was the worst class I have taken in college so far. He doesn't teach well in lectures and the only reason I learned anything was from working with other students during ta office hours to do the homework. Nice guy and all but he is horrible at teaching how to apply the material to the problems he will test you on.,0.0
"For this class, I keep going every lecture in the semester. I did good in the homework, lab, and 3 midterms. There is a friend who didnt even go to lectures and barely knew nothing 2 weeks before final exam. He did better than me in the final exam. I can only say this class is so stupid.",0.0
"He's a tough teacher but very helpful and readily available if you meet him halfway. If you don't attend lectures or office hours, he will probably be much less friendly come crunch time. No official textbook, but he compiles his class notes into a book that is requried",1.0
"I had Dr Keane for TAM 435, intermed fluid mech. Dr. Keane was fantastic at explaining the mathematics and practical laboratory application of fluid mechanics.  Funny, kind, and helpful, he is a rare instructor that is both likeable and challenges you to succeed. Introduced me to Tritton's ""Phys. Fluid Dyn."", my favorite ""causal reading"" fluids ref",1.0
"Don't buy the notes, just take your own in class. Also, go to class. He will literally tell you everything that will be on every exam. Very few students attended, which is why attendees easily get 90+% on exams and the average is 60%. Keane is clear, helpful, and doesn't take himself too seriously. Just go to every lecture and you'll get an A+.",1.0
"I'd say Keane's exams are fair.  That being said, lectures were useless seeing as he basically reads the notes that he's already written and made you buy from the bookstore.  At least 211 was easy, 335 is actually complicated so it makes it worse.",1.0
"The content in the class is easy, but Keane is always ready to screw up your grade - our final exam was way more difficult than it should have been, and he is quite possibly the meanest professor that I've ever dealt with",0.0
Going to class really helps if you decide to pay attention. All the people here saying you dont have to go to class probably didnt get an A. If you do the homework without just getting solutions and do the previous tests then you might get an A. He doesnt curve and his tests are worth a huge percent of the grade.Also his rubric is tough (94% for A),1.0

He has the grading scale set up in a way that you have room to make mistakes and learn - I came out with almost an A+ in the class, even after failing the first exam. Definitely my favorite class so far.",1.0
Great guy who genuinely cares about and believes in his students. Lectures were always interesting to me and the binder keeps you involved. But decent amount of homework and tests can be kind of difficult. Best advice is redo the practice weekly homework a couple times and take the practice exam before the real exam. Its definitely doable!,1.0

"Dr. Clegg is one of the best professors I have had. He is very passionate about teaching and biology, which made me excited to come to lectures. The way he structures his class allows you to actually understand the material, instead of just memorizing facts. Overall, Dr. Clegg genuinely cares about his students both academically and personally.",1.0
Professor Clegg is one of those professors who really cares for your success. His lectures are mandatory but they help a lot. He talks fast sometimes but it's just because he is super passionate about biology. His course demands that you put work outside of class if you want to receive a good grade. He's also hard to catch during office hours.,1.0
"He's great one on one but he kind of sucks if you only go to lectures. If you meet him for office hours or take it JS like I did, you'll love him. He's very caring and wants to see you succeed, he's not just there for his own research.",1.0
"Dr. Clegg is an amazing professor who is really passionate about the course that he teaches. The course was very well structured. Although the course mainly covers basic biology topics taught in high school, lectures are still really interesting and the questions he asks in lectures makes you think about these topics from a different perspective.",1.0
Clegg will be a professor I will remember forever because he genuinely cares about his students. IB 150 is a decently tough class but he makes it more bearable. He gives a lot of extra credit and gets excited when students do well on tests. Highly recommend taking any classes with Clegg,1.0
"Professor Clegg is a really great teacher, and it's obvious that he cares about all his students. He's super enthusiastic about biology, and can give good explanations to any questions you may have. The class isn't easy, but there is a lot of extra credit given, and you get a lot of points just for showing up to class. Overall, a solid professor.",1.0
"Professor Clegg is amazing, he takes time for every student that needs it. He is one of the rare few that actually cares about every single student's success. If you get a chance to take the James Scholar section, do it, because the Professor teaches your discussion section. I can't emphasize enough how good of a teacher he is.",1.0
"Great teacher and really shows that he cares about his students. Willing to meet with you outside of office hours if you need extra help. Gives tons of extra credit to help boost grades. Exams are hard but he makes it clear what he expects to be known. Be ready to put in work, though!",1.0
"Did not really learn anything new in this class. If you have an AP Bio background, you are basically set to breeze through the course. I did not particularly like the way lectures and discussions were set up, but they were not the death of me, either. Just be sure to do the practice exams and go over the learning objectives/goals before each exam.",0.0
"IB150 is in fact the easiest one comparing to all the other MCB courses I have taken. If you have taken AP biology or other bio courses in high school this course should not be a problem. Plus, even if you already know most of the knowledge you could still gain something new as he uses interesting examples. His learning strategies are great!",1.0
"Ben Clegg is not a good professor at all. His lectures are very boring and make no sense. This unit, I did not attend a single lecture and still did well on the exam. The one time I went to lecture, I did not get anything out of it and left like it was a waste of my time. He does a terrible job at explaining concepts.",0.0
"
                      IB 150 is supposed to be the easiest bio ever, but it did not feel that way. I put in so much work, did all the EC/HW/readings, and studied like crazy to end up with an A-. He was good, but his TA's aren't the best. The set-up of the course is also irritating. He himself is a good and knowledgable guy nonetheless.

Farhad is an absolutely amazing professor and the UO will suffer greatly without his knowledge. Having a teacher from the region of the world in which you are discussing benefits the subject in a number of ways. Professor Farhad has a plethora of knowledge on the subject of ME politics and did a great job in explaining these complexities to us.,1.0
"Farhad is the man. By far the best professor in the political science department at Illinois. Teaches the stuff how it should be taught, not edited for textbooks. Yes, his class is hard, but you will come away from his class knowing the real side of a topic. Illinois will be at a loss if he leaves. Take his class for the material, not for the grade",1.0
"Professor Malekafzali is far and wide my favorite professor at UIUC.  He is incredibly intelligent and will provide facts to back up his stance if you disagree.  His tests are hard but manageable, do the readings and attend every lecture.  I have never had a problem meeting with him to discuss papers, either, he is  pretty approachable.",1.0
"Prof. Malekafzali is by far my favorite professor on campus.  I've taken two classes with him.  You can tell he is passionate about what he teaches.  Attendance is not mandatory but I highly suggest you go!  He doesn't put any of his lectures up.  Keep up with the readings! Take a class with him if you can, before he leaves!",1.0

Very knowledgeable and passionate in what he teaches. Provides great information and isn't afraid to defend his stances.  Tests are fairly easy: matching; multiple choice; and an essay. Only recommendation is that you do the reading because it's NEVER discussed in class on shows up on the exam in the form of an essay questions (guaranteed) a few mc,1.0
"As far as professors go, he is INTENSE. But he is also very knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches. Class attendance is not officially mandatory, but if you want to pass you need to go every class. He is very nice and very accommodating to his students. You will learn a lot in his class as long as you do the reading and pay attention",1.0
I'm a senior and I can unequivocally say that he is one of the best professors on campus. All PS majors owe it to themselves to take this class. While it can drag on a little bit (3 hours everyone Wednesday when I took it) you don't really feel it since the material is really interesting and evokes a lot of participation and debate.,1.0

PS(homework) could be lengthy, but was graded on completion rather than correctness. Overall a very doable course",1.0
"Seems like a nice guy, but he is just an awful teacher. I can't understand half of what he says, he constantly loses his train of thought and he writes so fast that I can't keep up. I don't think he has clearly explained a single concept in the course so far, he just writes out derivations for 80 minutes. He makes the class 10x harder",0.0
"He is a little hard to understand, but overall great professor. Curves the midterms to an 81, and then curves the class to a median of 81. Attendance is optional, but he does still take attendance which I imagine he uses to bump your grade if youre on the border. The material is straight forward, and he does plenty of examples during class.",1.0
He is the worst professor I ever met. Only curve 3% for a midterm. His lecture is boring. He also has a terrible accent. I suggest Econ department hire a person who can talk in English.,0.0
"Yeah be is a little boring and he has accent. But who cares? He is a great professor that teaches you everything you need in HW and Exams. I mean, how rare is that? All you have to do is pay a little attention and you get an A.",1.0

"Arvid-Rad is definitely someone who loves to teach and it shows. However, while he clearly cares about his students, his lectures are incredibly dull and often repetitive. Homework grading is lax but exam grading is nit-picky. If you depend upon instructor accessibility, hes an awesome choice. Otherwise, hes solidly average.",1.0

"Probably one harder classes I've taken in general, and it didn't have to do with the material. Prof Arvin-Rad is a nice enough person, but he's a bad teacher; the practice exams he posts are much easier and nothing like the exam it's preparing you for, lectures are dry and boring, and he doesn't exactly go out of his way to make himself available.",0.0
"One of the worst lecturers I've had at university. Will spend inordinate amounts of time on inconsequential lecture topics. Also, difficult to follow, because he often rambles and loses his train of thought. If someone else is teaching econometrics, I suggest you take him or her instead.",0.0

"Yes his tests were hard, but they were accompanied by a 10% curve. Other than that, I have no complaints about anything he taught.

Would recommend.",1.0
"Exams can be difficult, but definitely doable. Also, he gives a pretty decent curve. Reading the textbook really helps, unless you pay close attention to class. Written portion of exam resembles the homework. The professor is helpful, but expects a bit more from students than the other econ professors at the university.",1.0

"He's a nice guy and all but this is one of the most boring classes I've ever taken. It was impossible to sit through. Good news is that you just get EC for going, so you technically don't get punished for missing - I recommend you get all EC possible though. The tests are tough so that'll make up for it. Also be prepared to take HOURS of notes.",1.0
"He is a good guy. He went to Harvard Buisness School. He is very smart and has a lot of real-life examples. BUT.

Easy A. Just memorize slides/ vocab.,1.0
Love is a nice guy but he's super boring. I fell asleep in most lectures but you should still go to get the clicker points. Read the book before the exams. The material is super basic and mainly common sense but you have to know the terms he's looking for.,1.0
"Lecture is pretty boring but you can get extra credit by showing up and doing the i-clickers. Make sure you read the textbook before exams, it will really help you out. He uses scenarios and hypothetical situations as most of the exam questions so you have to know how to apply the terms/topics and not just definitions.",1.0
"Attendance is mandatory because you get iclicker points. Everything in this class is easy, but the exams are difficult. The actual material is not difficult. However, there are too many powerpoint slides and hundreds of definitions to memorize for each exam. Love is a great professor, and he is very kind. You'll love him!",1.0
All I can remember about Prof. Love is his pink shirts!!!! And the fact that his class is interesting with the relevant movie clips and iClicker questions kept me focused.,1.0
"Basically, if you memorize all his slides you will get A's on his exams. Unfortunately, this is sometimes lots of material for one to digest easily in a short time span. Other than that, there is lots of opportunity for extra credit (can boost your grade by around 5% total) and it's very manageable to get at least a B in this class.",1.0
"The class is boring! Tests are harder than I expected especially the third one. Read the book is a must. He likes to test on details. Though he said we do not have to remember the examples in the book, some questions are from those. Would be helpful if he can tell us what will be in the test.",1.0
The material is very dry so its difficult to pay attention. You have to go to class in order to get attendance points with the iclicker. Good guy but he needs to give some hints as to whats on the exam. He emphasizes the slides but still no direction. It' d be nice if he said what to focus on. Its alot of material to cover when youre studying,1.0
"
                      The class is misleadingly easy, and the tests seem misleadingly easy until you get your grades back and find out you didn't do well. Basically just tells you to study everything for exams and makes the lectures as boring as they could possibly be. I dread going to class and have no motivation to try in it.

Seitz isn't as terrible as some of the reviews make him out to be but I would never take a class he teaches again.

The numerical quizzes are for grades and your own learning (not covered on the exam). Be prepared to collaborate with others to learn everything for the exam.,0.0
The course is more difficult because of how its run rather than the material itself.  He is zero help.  It's not the easy A everyone expects when taking an online course.  You don't actually learn any of the material.,0.0
It's not that he's a bad teacher; he's not a teacher at all. Absolutely no instruction whatsoever. This experience combined with the business school's attitude toward minors led me to drop the entire program. I can only assume this man is someone's brother-in-law.,0.0
Worst course taken by far. Gives zero feedback to students and doesn't understand the concepts himself. I tried to set up a meeting with him but he was too lazy to meet me in person and instead asked me to communicate through email. Avoid. At. All. Cost.,0.0
"He's the worst professor I've ever had. His lectures have no structure or content but go anyway because he has ""pop quizzes"" for a few extra credit points. You need the book to pass the quizzes online and exams in class. Only reason I survived this course was because I had friends in the class so we all worked together on a weekly basis.",0.0
"Horrendous professor. Showing up at his lectures is a COMPLETE waste of time as he does nothing but babble inaudibly. I showed up to all his lectures just to see if they would improve but they never did. If you HAVE to take his class, like I did, be prepared to teach yourself most of the material because this guy is utterly useless as a teacher.",0.0
"Ruined my interest in accounting, I wish I could have learned the material from a different professor to see if the material would have been explained better. Learning from the book it wasn't too terribly difficult material but the professor was just so vague about what was included on tests and how to prepare and reach success in the course",0.0
"Disappointed that the business department has this professor teaching all of the business minor students,a disservice to them. This class was 1 lecture a week and the rest online videos. Word of advice, I found the textbook the most useful resource. Silhan voice is difficult to understand and spends little time teaching for a 80 minute lecture.",0.0
"Unfortunately, this man is the only professor for Accy 200 (a mandatory class for BUS minor students). Silhan is an ineffective teacher in the fact that his lectures are meaningless and has a panic attack if someone sits the wrong way during a test. Don't let him make you dislike ACCY just because of his poor teaching methods",0.0
"Actually the worst instructor ever. First he cuts down on meetings per week from 2 to 1, because he wanted to do a ""blended"" online and in-person class, which is fine. Lecture's supposed to be 1.25 hours. He's supposed to teach, then give a quiz for EC. He babbles for about 15 minutes, if that, gives the quiz, and we're done with lecture.",0.0

"He's disorganized and not a very effective teacher, the grade boundaries are generous though. Regularly studying for the quizzes would make sure you're prepared for the exams (quizzes and exams differ vastly though) I did learn the basics of accy though this being my first accy class (part of biz minor) but wouldn't wanna be taught by him again :/",1.0
"Silhan does not know how to teach, and his course is relatively useless; I got a 94, 75, and 56 on the exams in that order; going to office hours is really helpful, much easier to learn from the TA's than Silhan. Overall, with the extra credit, it should be easy to get a B without trying too terribly hard.",0.0
The problem is this class is useless.  I really learned nothing about Accy and wasn't interested in doing so.  Not much work... and i think that's why i didn't do well.  No review. review sessions are a joke.  It's a useless class.  Just make sure to go to lecture and read though and you should be able to get a b or better,0.0
"This man is smart. However, his ability to teach what he knows is minimal at best. He teaches a certain way to let you learn the quizzes, but the exams have nothing to do with it. They are all over general information instead of specifics. Since this is 85 percent of your grade, very difficult go do well.",0.0

                      Not terrible, but not fun by any means. He can be entertaining. Little tough on quizzes and tests, but come to class, get extra credit, and you should be ok.

"He loves films, it shows quite a bit. Gives out a lot of handouts, and most are useless (like reviews or something). I had four major papers, he seems to grade easier if you talk to him about your paper beforehand. The exams are not the best, but not horrible. The films he chose were very interesting ones.",1.0
Easily my worst professor so far. He will go on rants about the most irrelevant things and will keep talking even after the bell rings. If you show up late you will get singled out publicly. Everything is done on paper so you can't check your grade or assignments online. He will handout 2-4 useless papers per day. Drop or transfer from his section.,0.0
"Worst. This will be the first and the last time I rate a professor. His tone is terrible in explaining things. Keep complaining about stuffs in the society, he barely skim through textbook and expect us to always be prepared for everything. Your tuition deserves to be invested in a better place.

Thinks too much of himself and the class. Very rude when it's not even necessary and the content of the class was interesting but pick to be with someone other than him.,0.0
Assigned lots of busy work and graded by deducting points with very little constructive feedback. Generally unpleasant.,0.0
"Do your best. Must attend class and submit your weekly assignment in deadline. He is kind of old-fashioned type. Not checking email and using online system. His own guideline is very important, so if you follow his guideline correctly, guarantee A grade. Think he gives curved grade.",0.0
"He is very strict about attendance and turning in your papers on time.  He has no patience for laziness and will make it known.  He can be rude and harsh at times but he is a good teacher.  He knows what he's talking about and I learned a lot from him.  If you are sensitive, don't take it.  If you want to learn, I would definitely suggest his class",1.0
"He was an unecessary tough grader. Focused more on irrelevant points of a paper rather than actual content(i.e syntax of works cited vs. entire paper). In class he doesn't have the best attitude.

"Very unclear with directions and when will take points off for minor details. If you revise your papers towards all of his notes, still won't get a good grade on it. His email responses are very rude and how he criticizes his students is untactful. Do yourself a favor and find a different professor.",0.0
Knows his stuff and makes class entertaining,1.0
"This class is easy if you're neurotic, but hard if you don't pay attention to fine detail. That being said, I made a few typing errors and was not penalized. This course was self-paced and it was hard to keep on schedule with no due dates. Some mistakes on compass that do not benefit the student. He usually does not fully answer questions via email",0.0
"This guy is majorly unprofessional. Not only does he send emails without salutations, but he forgets to post essential notes needed for writing assignments. When you email him about said notes, he rudely responds and acts as if it is your fault. Clearly he thinks this 100-level is SUPER IMPORTANT.",0.0
This class is a 100 level course but he acts like it's a 300 level. I'm taking it right now & I'm just extremely disappointed in it. I was excited to take this course & now I'm constantly stressed about doing the insane amounts of homework done instead of actually learning the material. You have to watch at least 6 hours of film a week. Don't take.,0.0
He gives obnoxious amounts of homework.  Its a 100-level class and it's requiring much more work than any 300 or 400 classes.  He's a difficult grader and takes a rude tone in comments.,0.0
"This guy knows his stuff. I got out of the class with an A-, but I couldn't slack off in the class. Use his office hours for papers! He's a tough grader, so if you're not a very good writer, don't be shy asking for help. His class is a fun discussion, but don't think it's an easy class because you're watching movies. It's a pretty interesting class",1.0
"He's very knowledgable and passionate about what he does. However, he is a tough grader on papers, you can't slack off on them. Utilize his office hours! It's a fun discussion class, but don't think it's a blow off class because of movies. He does a good job of challenging everyone.",1.0
"The negative reviews threw me off, this guy is great! The lowest grade I got on a paper was a B+, but you need to put effort into the assignments. He's full of energy and loves talking about films, and encourages you to approach him. If you pay attention in class, do the readings, and go to the lab, you'll do fine.",1.0
"I was terrified to take this class after reading reviews but I'm glad I did. He is passionate, very clear, few papers for homework and rarely refers to book, and xams are straightforward. HOWEVER, he is rude via email, rarely lets discussion out on time, and goes off on tangents. Take this class if you have him for discussion/dont take if online.",1.0

                      Obviously when someone comments ""tough, but fair"" is totally written by the professor himself....because simply he really just sucks... he has no respect for students,(if he did, i wouldn't say he suck),  not responsible NOT FAIR because he is not helpful, and who writes tough but fair?!

"While Professor Gollin definitely cares about his students, and works to improve the course, I didn't really like the methods of instruction. For example, there weren't specific examples in lecture. However, he genuinely cares about the students. He's a nice person - and I've talked to him about other things unrelated to physics.",1.0
"Professor Gollin extremely available outside of lecture and is very helpful in office hours. However, his lectures veer of track at times. He is also pretty unforgiving and sends terse reply emails that show a lack of respect. The class is designed pretty well but is more work that normal for 2 credit hours. He is a pretty cool guy though.",1.0

Professor Gollin is a wonderful person; he clearly cares about his students more than I've ever seen in a professor. But I cannot stand the way he teaches physics. One can only spend so many hours calculating the relativistic speeds of intergalactic trash compactors before wondering why you're wasting so much time solving such nonsensical problems.,0.0
"Prof. Gollin cares a lot about his students. If you are struggling, ask to meet with him one-on-one. He will do his best to help you.

"Gollin is a solid professor. He is nice, cares about students, and wants them to succeed.

Followed Randy for my freshmen year and learned a lot. Homework is good material for study as well as the worksheets he assigned in discussions. He does before class exercising with question regarding material learned before but I can't get up that early... Lecture is really useful and try to put effort in the study.,1.0
"Calc 2 is notoriously hard,but Randy made it very manageable. The TAs I had were phenomenal and without them I wouldn't have passed. While at times it seemed like I was in way over my head, he assigns lots of problems (both homework and practice) and is very forgiving in his grading policies.",1.0
"Good professor, lectures are super helpful! He tells you exactly what each problem on the test will be on however, the tests are tough. Fair grading policy ( doesn't curve but will replace one midterm with the final.) You can tell he wants you to learn not just get a grade. Hard class but I actually learned calculus.",1.0

"Even through I didn't get an awesome grade, Professor McCarthy is a great math professor. Lectures are amazing, go to them! He's very clear and doesn't over complicate things. Tests are pretty hard, but he tells you what's on them! He has a grade replacement policy and overall is a fair grader. Definitely recommend.",1.0
Lectures are helpful because he goes over some questions that will likely be tested on. Lots of what he says will be unclear unless you pre read the section  he is going over. With this class its all on you to understand the material. Use the tutoring its free. Use the past exams and the outlines of the test he gives before the exam.,1.0
"The lectures are barely useful and he spends 20 minutes on theorems in order to help you understand that just end up confusing you and wasting class time. He attempts to give extra help with tutoring and practice tests but with 1 TA for 20 students and no answer key, who does this really help? Also picks trick questions for exams on purpose.",0.0
"Professor McCarthy loves to add online assignments with just a couples days notice (a huge inconvenience when trying to deal with an engineering workload), his tests and assignments are rather loosely based around what he actually teaches during lectures, and he's a very harsh grader.

"He's a pretty great teacher. I took the engineering section of calc 2 first semster and dropped it quickly. But when i took his class in the spring, i did awesome in it and he loves it if you ask him questions after class and in office hours.

Need to go to class to get iClicker points (not extra credit). Barely gives any review materials to prepare for midterms/final.

"Andino was an okay teacher. All the lecture material was put online and material that was covered in lecture was in the book. For me, the book explained things a lot better than the demos. Clicker questions were worth points and were not extra credit, so I went to lecture just to get clicker points.",1.0

"Honestly, Andino wasn't that great of a teacher. He constantly rushed lectures towards the end, extremely disorganized, and not great at explaining.

"If you need to take Chem and only are in it for the GPA, take Andino. His tests I found were much easier than what i've heard from other students with different professors.

                      What a doll.  Dr. Moore is such an extraordinary individual - so dedicated to his students, yet an incredibly accomplished and admired chemist in the world of research.  The class is challenging, the tests are hard, but he is never ambiguous about what his expectations are.  Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Nobel in his future - don't miss him!

                      Sometimes assumes everyone has prior experience with Java, so his explanations are unclear for those of us who have not. The incredibly generous extra credit points makes up for the difficulty of the class, though. I would say his forte is in CS 398 and not 125, though.

He was very proud of being Italian so I think if you cooked him a nice pasta dinner you'd be his best friend. Quirky, unpredictable and a little off the cuff sometimes. Kind of had to teach myself in this class.",1.0
"This class taught by Rispoli is challenging, but not impossible. He teaches in a way where you are not spoon-fed all the material.

I highly recommend that you take SHS 120 with Rispoli if you want an easy A.

"Extremely hard professor. However, if you can motivate yourself to read half a book a week (200-250 pages) you'll get an A in the class. There's only one (long paper).

"If you understand politics understand that this professor's career is propagated by selling books and giving speeches about his very socialist view of power, media, and politics.

"Mondak is an accomplished opera singer turned political scientist, which he demonstrates every Friday. In gorgeous operatic tones, he recaps the major lessons from the week. He doesn't just sing the lessons--he performs them with uncommon passion. Although others seemed more impressed with athleticism, we should not overlook his angelic voice.",1.0

"one of the strongest dancers on the political science faculty. although he is not classically trained as a dancer, his raw talent is eye-popping. it also makes for effective teaching. in my intro class, the prof tried to explain the condorcet jury theory 1000 times. mondak taught it 1 time thru interpretive dance. i will remember it now forever",1.0
"mondak's summer class is a feast for the mind AND a feast for the eye. at first, i was puzzled that the class was scheduled to meet at the beach. but on the first day mondak gave an epic lecture on the problems of american politics in rhinestone covered speedo. not even james madison could rival this display of political prowess.",1.0
it is difficult to know if he is a man or a god. especially difficult on fridays because he wears a He-Man costume. take the politics of dance. you will learn a ton from his interpretative dance stylings (especially the dance about money in politics). this guy can really shake it. he earns every dollar. encore! encore!,1.0
this was the most demanding course I have ever took. But it made a man out of me. And the feats of strength which are legendary around here lived up to the hipe. i grew up in the yukon and i have seen men wrestle bears and win before. but i have never seen a man dominate a bear like mondak did. bonus points for wearing bedazzled wrestling tunic,1.0
"mondak's ability to interpret the complexities of politics through performative dance is second to none. i have have seen many poli sci profs here try to convey lessons thru dance and fail hard. not him. also, his dancing demonstrates the dignity and grace that one would expect from a scholar and a gentleman, despite what some may think.",1.0
"Just completed Mondak's ""politics of good and evil"" special topics course. it combined biblical wisdom with raunchy Magic Mike style dancing. i noticed on the syllabus that mondak calls himself an endowed chair of political science. after this class i know why.",1.0
"Mondak looks like he has been cut from stone and stuffed into spandex. He looks like an old school American Gladiator. Just as impressively, when he lectures, his voice sounds just like the Cookie Monster. That takes some getting used to. But he is a gifted lecturer. And he knows so much stuff about politics. Like stuff I had never heard of.",1.0
The semester is only half over but this has been one of the most profound experiences of my life. Professor Mondak is a breath taking combination of Konan the Barbarian and Winston Churchill. He has the rippling muscles of Konan and wisdom of Churchill. Good thing it's not the other way around. Especially cuz he wears those buckskin leggings.,1.0
"I took this class during summer session thinking it would be a breeze.  But on the first day of class, Mondak--aka the Hulk--smashed a two-by-four with his bare hands and screamed ""You do not want to mess with the warrior!"" Needless to say, there were no discipline problems in the class. he did lighten the mood with jokes and gave great lectures",1.0
Mondak defies categorization.  He has both brains and brawn.  He is both a warrior and a diplomat.  He is both beauty and the beast.  His lectures on politics will expand your mind.  His feats of strength will blow your mind.  Imagine a hairless gorilla with opposable thumbs and vast knowledge of politics.  That is Dr. Mondak.,1.0
"Although many of my classmates were most impressed by some combination of Mondak's bulging muscles, skin-tight buckskin leggings, and mastery of political knowledge, I will remember him most for his soulfulness.  On the last day of class he sang a wistful version of Bob Seager's ""Like a Rock.""  I cried without shame.",1.0
"Dr. Mondak goes above and beyond for this students.  When we all showed for class and door to the room was locked, he smashed through the wall like Kool-Aid man.  Then he dusted himself off and led the class in an epic discussion where the United States is headed as a country. He shows us brawn and brains each day and he is a great American.",1.0
mondak is an amazing lecturer and strong like a bull.  but i thought the day he carried the refrigerator across campus was a rare miss.  sure it was impressive to see him pick it up over his head and run down the quad with it and then up all those stairs.  but it took like 20 minutes and he has nothing to prove.  nobody doubts his god like power.,1.0
the group project was terrible.  i was in a group of 3 and i felt like i was the middle link in a human centipede.  but mondak was awesome.  he juggled bowling balls while lecturing about voting behavior.  he carried a refrigerator across campus and up 4 flights of stairs then taught us about political parties.  he made learning fun.,1.0
"Mondak's classes are intense but ultimately good for you.  Before spring break, he overheard some of us saying we were not in shape for wearing swimming suits on spring break.  He then made the whole class run in place all class period long the whole week before break.  The class has helped me learn about politics.  I have also lost 12 pounds.",1.0
"
                      My favorite part of any day of class with Dr. Mondak is that when he make a really good point, he flexes his massive biceps and pounds his chest with pride like a gorilla.    On average, he makes about 5 to 10 really good points EVERY class.  It is impossible to zone out because the flexing and chest pounding keeps everyone really focused.

She's awesome.,1.0

                      Trish Loughran is the BEST professor I have ever had!

It was a great class which you can learn a lot. There were 3 multiple-choice exams in total and he curved everytime to make sure students who put effort in it will receive A.

One of my favorite things about Sellers' class is that it was the only class that I actually wanted to go to every day.  We actually had conversations in class instead of lectures and got to know everyone.  If you haven't had him sign up for whatever he's teaching.  It will be good.,1.0

"I took HIST 120 with Toby a few years ago. He's very smart and seems really interested in the research he does, but not so much in this course itself. The syllabus was too broad. There's a LOT of reading, lecture attendance is mandatory but they're hard to follow. The exam ""study guides"" will have you busting your rear end for hours upon hours.",0.0
"Terrible, terrible professor. He spends all of his lectures droning on about irrelevant facts and then has material that is entirely unrelated on his exams. Avoid at all costs.",0.0
"I came back to rate this professor again,  Spare yourselves and never take a class with him ever. The ungodly amount of work involved towards the end of the semester will make your head spin. The four novels were short but if you have a packed schedule consider a different class. The tests cover TOO much material. Even the TA's agree.",0.0
"Professor Toby is knowledgable in this field of studies, but he can't teach at all. He rambles on and on about random pottery and irrelevant art. It's nice but completely not related to the course. His tests are not easy but not too difficult. But he tends to ask for a few random people that aren't important. Also his pop quizzes are meaningless.",0.0
"A ridiculous amount of work for what you get out of it. His rambly lecture style puts you to sleep, and its very difficult to take notes on.

Very disorganized syllabus and lectures.",0.0
"A terrible lecturer. I could see like half of the class asleep one time. And takes attendance. Also yells at the student who is whispering. Without a study guide, it was particularly hard class.

Professor Nikolaev likes to teach in depth of the materials. People usually don't get the point the first time. He makes the materials hard but reading notes helped a ton.

While the material can occasionally be difficult, he is very clear about what he wants from you and very fair.  As long as you show him that you're engaged and trying hard he will do everything he can to help you out!

"Likeable person, extremely poor teacher. Although many students find him entertaining, I would rather take a course by someone who takes the course subject more seriously.

Dr. Notaro is one of my favorite professors at UIUC.  He's definitely quirky and his tests are a little tricky but I still got an A.

Go to lecture though.,1.0

                      I hate math, but this class was great!  Dr. Notaro is the man!  I took it in the fall and he always predicted football scores!  The class is really easy, but if you don't go you might get confused.  Lab and discussion are different.  Don't buy the book.  You NEVER crack it.  You get like 10-page review sheets for the exams.  They are easy!

"Farrand is an amazing professor! Although the class is fairly difficult, he is really good at explaining everything thoroughly. He was a sub for one of my other classes, and it was the only lecture out of the entire semester that I understood.",1.0
"Rambles on and on and dances around points. Not horribly though, but not as clear as Slauch. Tests focus mostly on application",1.0
"Good things: Really passionate, knowledgable, helpful, and really nice when you go talk to him in office hours. I emailed him once 10 minutes before the exam and he answered my question fully in time. Bad things: not enough detail on slides, impossible tests, boring delivery, material could be presented in a better way.",1.0
"Dr. Farrand is amazing. He's so excited about genetics, it makes you excited as well. His part of the class covers fascinating material. Extremely helpful professor as well, holds lots of office hours, answers all of the questions. Tests are hard(but interesting), and if you study diligently, you will get a good grade. I loved his teaching :).",1.0
How to get an A on Dr. Farrands tests. 1) Throw away the textbook 2) Buy yourself a voice recorder form the money you didn't spend on the textbook 3) Show up and record every lecture 4) Review lecture recording while looking at PowerPoint slides 5) Review notes you made from recording and review slides 6) repeat step 5 and 7)Take a pre-test dump,1.0
His lectures have almost zero detail that is required on exams. Exams are ridiculously difficult for a 200 level course. I have taken lots advanced mcb courses and have gotten better grades than 250 in all of them. You have no idea what he's going to put in his exams. It's like being taught one thing and tested on another.,0.0
"He is extremely passionate about the subject. He sometimes gets so carried away he speaks really quickly but he is always clear. Best advice: record the lectures. Everything is important, from a general concept to the slightest detail. He is there to help. He loves it when questions are asked. Use him as a resource. The exams are VERY difficult.",1.0

Dr. Farrand is an exceptional teacher. With that said he is also very difficult. His tests require you to memorize everything and apply concepts to experimental situations.

Each test has an essay portion worth 50% of the grade, and he's very particular about what you must write to get a great grade.

"This class is interesting, but the professor does a terrible hob at getting things graded on time. He also isn't very fair overall such that his TA does half the grading, which is often not very good. Expectations for the essays are very limited, which can easily bring down your grade. Be careful!",0.0
"He's not the best lecturer, but he is entertaining in an awkward kind of way. He adds random jokes and even more random clips to spice up his lectures (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, anyone?) which adds to why you should go to class.

Dr. Schneider is very liberal and makes it known.  She always talks about how conservative presidents are to blame for all of the nations problems.

John Rubins is the best teacher I've had at U of I. He is hilarious and genuinely cares about his students. Attending class is actually fun and he gives you so much room for creativity on stories that it hardly feels like a class if you enjoy writing. His classes are a MUST TAKE!,1.0
"Rubins has been the best teacher I've had here at UIUC. He's funny, willing to listen, and doesn't try to control the conversation.

"As others have said, Manisha is a FANTASTIC professor and a brilliant person, but she is quite difficult. Grading is particular and makes a 200lvl feel at times like a more advanced class.

His lectures were kinda boring and he really talked about useless stuff in class. Many of the exam questions came from things that were unrelated to the class. DO NOT TAKE THIS! It really isnt worth it and you dont learn anything.,0.0
IF LOOKING FOR EASY GEN-ED--STOP! Don't take this class--my TA graded the papers VERY hard and the tests were all about stupid details that didn't prove what you knew but rather what you could memorize. I'm an MCB major...I don't have time to read 5 books..in great detail..for a genEd..who does anyway???,1.0
"By far one of the most talented and knowledgable history professors i've ever had. interesting and thoroughly out, but you HAVE to go to the lectures. way better than CLCV115. also don't listen to the bad reviews, if they think he's a bad prof they obviously don't deserive to be at the u of i.",1.0
"the most montone and boring lectures i have ever been to in my entire life! ive gone home with a sore neck several times bc ive always fallen asleep in lincoln hall's very uncomfortable chairs! tests are detailed but not impossible, i got Bs & studied for probly 4 hrs for each. essays make up most of your grade & are graded fairly.",0.0
"He doesn't make you feel guilty for not getting something right away.  He's helpful, interesting, and he cares about what he's teaching and making sure we understand it... even if we don't get it right away.  He's also very good to TAs.",1.0
VERY hard tests! The reading is quite heavy but you don't have to do all of it. Papers make your grade in the class. They are really really easy and graded very linently. Got As on all the papers.,0.0
"This class is awful & even though it fulfills 2 geneds, do not take it unless u like memorizing meticulous, random details & writing lengthy papers. Sansone rambles on in lecture & it's very difficult to sense what is and is not important (although on the test, every detail is important). The tests are very specific and tricky.",0.0

This class was for a gen ed.  The tests really sucked and he was very bad at lecturing! I would not recomend this class because he required so much reading and didn't ask relevant test questions at all!,0.0

He seemed like a nice guy. I could never stay awake in lecture so I stopped going. I read for the tests but he asked some obscure questions so I did not so well. The papers were pretty easy and not graded hard at all. It was not the easy gen ed I was expecting. I would not recomend taking it if you are looking for an easy gen ed.,1.0
"The exams are somewhat easy if you go to class. But asks some really ridiculous random questions. But the papers are hard, and graded extremely precisly, they look for every little mistake. Sansone comes off as a pompous ass, that thinks he's funny, but isn't, and tells really bad jokes.",1.0
"Rambles a lot. Topics covered over 50 min could be done in 10.  Papers are graded ridiculously, require in depth knowledge not provided in class.  No rubric and sketchy guidelines make the papers difficult.  Exams, not so bad, as long as you study.  Overall, I would not take.",0.0

                      This was an easy GenEd when I took it last year. The lectures are sometimes boring. He's usually very on time for office hours if you want to look over your graded exam. The exams were really easy; you don't have to read all the required books just take good notes in class!

"I love this professor!! Even though Im not an english major, this class rocked and I would love to take another class with her!! she loves what she does and it shows. I actually bought THE BIG SLEEP and YELLOW WALLPAPER because of her class.",1.0
Don't listen to the idiot who commented below me. That person obviously never once make an effort to actually go to class bc that's where she gives out the whole plot and questions that will appear on the quizzes. So stop lying you got the grade you deserved for being lazy.,1.0
"A fairly easy class, but you MUST read the books in the time she gives you. Gives out quizzes that are 5% of the final grade, tough if you don't read the books. Tests are easy, spark notes is the only studying required. Nice,but lied when she said she only gives out A's and B's. Apparently an average test grade of an A- equates to a C+ in the class",0.0
I loved this class! Foote is hilarious and down to earth. she definitely knows who her audience is! really easy,1.0
"Great professor!! Super easy, just sparknotes the books before the four quizzes and you'll do great. One of the best professors I have had. Very funny",1.0
"I had fun in her class. As long as you at least sparknote the books you have to read and go to lectures all the time, you're going to get an easy A. She is funny and makes the class interesting.",1.0
"Amazing Teacher!!!!! Extremely easy easy A and easy gen ed! Just read a couple of short stories and some books and you WILL do fine! Great sense of humor, very helpful, and so kind. The books are easy. The mid term and final are super easy, but you have to actually read the books and stories, and come to lecture.",1.0
"This is lots of reading to do, not all the books are fun, and there can be a few tricky questions on the tests. ENG 103 thus is not an ""easy A"" per se.However, it is one of those rare classes you might not be happy at all when the professor wraps up the lecture early. Take this class, if nothing else,than to enjoy Foote's fascinating wit and humor!",1.0

Professor Foote is fabulous!  Her lectures are entertaining and the books are relatively simple.  Go to lectures (she tells you everything you need to know for the quizzes) and read the books for an easy A.,1.0
"Good teacher. Keeps lectures interesting, and can relate to the students.  The readings aren't bad at all, and there are no assignments except 4 quizzes and 2 exams which are pretty easy if you do all of the readings. I would recommend this class.",1.0

"Great class! Honestly, I don't usually like to do the reading for my classes, but the books in ENGL 103 are really FUN and INTERESTING. And lecture is really interesting too--I actually wanted to go to this class. Only advice: don't underestimate the final. It was worth 50% of the final grade, so just review everything a little before taking it!",1.0

"There's no doubt that Leininger clearly cares about teaching. However, he seems to overcomplicate things all the time, and we can clearly see students are just as lost as I am. Furthermore, the test and homework questions are nothing like the lectures, and sometimes he uses a long, long way of work to solve a problem that doesn't need it. Awful.",0.0
"Most inspiring math professor I have ever had. He made every effort to make himself available (daily office hours), and was more than willing to answer questions during/after lecture. His office hours were invaluable as he was able to provide both geometric and analytic interpretations of the course theorems. Would recommend reading the textbook.",1.0
"I really liked Prof. Leininger. He is really, really funny, engaging and makes the lectures somewhat interesting (there is only so much he can do to make calculus interesting). He is also very kind and always willing to help outside of class and also after class. I definitely really liked him and would take his class again.",1.0
"Leininger is a great teacher. He cares about his students! He posted our lectures online and lecture notes occasionally online as well. He gave out review sheets for exams and pulled no tricks. His grading policy was very fair, and I don't think I would've passed the class if I didn't have him. If he's an option for a professor, take him!",1.0
"He was far and away my favorite Math professor.  I struggled in his class and did not do well, but he did everything in his power to help.  He answers emails promptly, and is very receptive to feedback and questions.  I would take any class by him again if I could 10/10 would recommend.",1.0
"Tough class, one of the easier professors. Posts lecture videos and notes online.",1.0
"Clear lectures for the most part. It could get boring when he does the proofs. Sometimes he goes too fast leaving some students lost and confused, but most of the time he is very clear. Much better than Tolman. Scales most exams.  Midterm 1: moderately difficult (A-) Midterm 2: easy (A) Midterm 3: moderately difficult (A+) Final: Difficult (A-)",1.0
"Professor Leininger is a great professor. He is very helpful and holds frequent office hours, especially near the time of an exam. He is very clear and easy to understand in  all of his lectures, and class is very engaging.",1.0
"His course is amazing, interesting and easy.",1.0
He is really good. His lectures are super helpful and he has a great sense of humor. His office hours are really helpful as well. I learned a lot from him.,1.0
"I took MATH 241 with Leininger freshman year, and he was probably the best teacher I had that year. It was by no means an easy course, and you had to really work for an A, but his lectures were always interesting,  and covered the material very well.",1.0
"Although he lectures a bit fast sometimes, Leininger explains Calc 3 concepts very well. The book is not necessary, but it's a nice resource to understand the material better. Practice tests are provided online, so you will know what is expected on midterms. I highly recommend him!",1.0
"Leininger does a great job explaining the topics. The book is not necessary, but it is a nice resource to get more information for more clarification, since he does lecture at a slightly fast pace (for me). Practice tests are provided online, so you will know what is expected on the midterms. Highly recommend Leininger!",1.0
It's hard because of the nature of the course.  He's really funny and that was an incentive to go to lecture.,1.0
"He's a solid professor overall. He's wildly intelligent, and unfortunately, that shows when he proves things on the board in every lecture. He can be hard to follow, but he does a decent job of explaining, and the difficulty of the homework makes the quizzes and tests easy as pie",1.0
"In the beginning of the semester, I went to both his lectures and Schenck's lectures. If possible, choose Leininger! He explains the concepts more thoroughly and spends more time trying to help his students understand the material. Go to office hours! Calc3 may not be easy to learn, but it was the most interesting calculus class I've taken so far.",1.0
"Good lecturer, really helps you to understand the concepts in depth.  Did not need the book at all, actually.  Just don't sweat the tests because he DOES curve them and he curves them generously.",1.0
"You can tell Leininger is a really smart guy (loves to do long proofs in lecture).  Once you get used to his teaching style, you realize he's very good at explaining the more difficult concepts of Calc 3.  Definitely take advantage of his office hours-he's very helpful!  Exams are pretty easy... do the practice exams and the book's chapter reviews.",1.0
"Took his honors course; it was brilliant. Class format is great; gives partial points easily although tests are difficult. I'm not sure about large lectures, but his honors course was genius.",1.0
"
                      He goes into long proofs of things you won't even have to know and never really fully explains things in lecture. you might as well just go to the discussion sections or read the book, it is more helpful.

The best professor ever. Great (video) lectures. Really caring and understanding.,1.0
"He is very irresponsible to his course and his students. He always changes his course schedule and posts some weird assignments. Instructions were not clear, and exams were even worse. He didn't test your understanding of the material. Instead, he tested you on materials that he didn't taught. Definitely worst professor ever",0.0
"Tough class, but perhaps the best one I have in college/grad school. Professor taught critical thinking and emphasized concepts. Questions discussed in class were intriguing and inspiring. Much reading. Heavy project. I would recommend!",1.0
"Helpful and interesting lectures. Homework was heavy, but TA turptorials helped a lot. Generous grading with lots extra credits.",1.0
He is funny but he does not teach well. I will recommend that instead of going through quickly from slides better explain the concept and show how can you apply the concept to a small problem.  You are at your own to figure out stuff,0.0
"The materials were hard and he went through it way too fast. Homeworks took a lot of time, but you could get some help by attending the tutorial and the TA office hours. Exams were very tough, you would have to understand each concept to do well. If you take it as 3 credits, make sure to do the extra-credit project to boost your grade.",0.0

"Her lecture style is not conducive for taking notes. Its highly anecdotal in its nature so difficult to take notes of important facts.

"Extremely smart. Doctorate from Yale and it shows in her comprehensive, yet tedious lectures. No reason not to do well as her office hours are seldom utilized, hence highly accessible.

"Professor Oberdeck is a overall a great professor. She knows her history, and she seems very passionate about it. Lectures can be a bit boring and seem to last forever.

                      Good lecturer. He focuses more in learning rather than examinations/grading. He usually goes off topics and calls off classes.

"He's a smart guy, that loves to show it. The assignments were vague and his reasoning for grading was impossible to follow. If you visit office hours and get as much info as to what he wants, then you'll do well. However, he pretty much wants your analyzes to follow what his ideas are. Not a lot of room to interpret things your own way.",0.0
"It is extremely important to meet your deadlines. Although I met mine and received an A in the course, many of my friends lost letter grades for forgetting to respond to online convos. That noted, the material's extremely interesting and abstract. Ernstmeyer breaks it down pretty well while maintaining interest.",1.0
"Awesome class, awesome dude.",1.0
This class in no way represents a 100 level. It is way too involved and is not worth the work just for a gen-ed requirement. Phillip is condescending and refuses to explain topics in a way that undergraduates can understand. It also is not rewarding when the teacher constantly tells students that they are wrong.,0.0
"This class was challenging, but Prof. Ernstmeyer was always available to help clarify any confusion and would gladly take questions in class.  We were expected to discuss poems in detail, make well-informed interpretations, and recognize poetic devices and styles.  This class was one of my favorites, and Prof. Ernstmeyer really knows his stuff.",1.0

"One of my favorite professors. I could tell he is extremely interested and knowledgeable in what we were covering in class. He always encouraged participation and discussion, but had his own points to make to ensure we understood why we read what we did for the day. Personable and very helpful.

"I couldn't have asked for more from Phillip's Poetry Since 1940 course. His dedication to the class is, honestly, astounding. He does a fantastic job of leading a class discussion that draws on student feedback but is still focused. Super available and willing to help. His love for the poetry we covered is infectious. Brilliant course.",1.0
"Awesome professor. Class involves a lot of reading & writing but that is obvious. Be prepared to re-write essays multiple times.

Class might not be that interesting, but this teacher rocks!",1.0
"Great professor! I hope to take one of his classes in the future. He is incredibly smart and intersting, and quite amusing at times. Poetry will take on quite a new meaning for you if you take this class. It will be difficult at times but that's how college is. I doubt you will regret taking his class.",1.0
"I always looked forward to this class! Phillip is a very genuine and intelligent teacher. He was always willing to meet with students and eager to hear various interpretations of the poems we read. The course included a refreshing variety of poets instead of the dead white male norm. The expectations were very clear, making it easy to do well.",1.0
"Great class! If you attend class, participate and turn in all assignments on time you will be very successful! There are no actual letter grades. Grading is based on if you meet the deadlines and participation. Although there are no grades, he still gives tons of feedback on assignments so you can easily see how you're doing!",1.0
Negatives: 30% of your grade is ambiguous because it's partcipation and overall improvement in course. Prompts and explanations of them can be confusing at times. Positives: VERY HELPFUL especially at conferences. 70% turning in papers on time. No grades. Just lot of postive criticism that help you improve as a writer.,1.0
his commentary was really harsh but you get to grade yourself,1.0
"Philip, is probably one of the most intelligent people I have ever met.  His grading is a little vague and ambiguous, therefore I have no idea how I am doing.  Everyone in advanced comp does not care about the material they just want their grade and be done with the requirement.  His assignments are harsh and somewhat unrealistic.",0.0

                      Cool professor that may use swear words but hard class. You will have to  put a lot of hours into writing long essays. Attendance not mandatory but turning homework 1 day late= 1/3 of a letter grade reduction. Hard but not impossible class, just thons of hours writing and revising papers. Talks too much for too little material. Helpful though, ok.

Vector calculus is a difficult class and he made every attempt to explain the underlying conceptual basis of the material. Highly recommended.",1.0
"Cellarosi is a fantastic professor.  You can tell he's really excited about what he's teaching, and he makes it rub off on you.  Always eager to answer questions, sometimes will keep you longer after class to explain more than you asked about, just cause he loves math so much.",1.0
"Gives very clear explanations and is very passionate about math.  Also tells a fair share of funny jokes.  I consider myself a good math student and had only gotten A's before this class.

"Wise was almost the complete opposite of all these reviews I read before I took this course. If you go to lecture, take notes, and do all the assignments it is a very dull but somehow interesting course. Though there are no test preps, by going through notes and studying them the tests will not be difficult at all. I enjoyed Wise and the course.",1.0
"Overall, seems like a nice guy. But with 0  materials to help you prepare for exams or even to review lectures you are pretty much on your own.

Advise not taking",0.0
"The worst ADV professor, ever. Always referring to the syllabus whenever being asked, even though the one that you don't understand too he demands you to read it for his answer(s). Not giving a clear guideline for assignments and no guides at all for exams. Lectures are mostly heavy-empty and he does not give you outlines for that. So good luck.",0.0

If an assignment is due you better be to class real early or he literally will not accept it and you receive a 0. His lectures are quite unclear as he goes off on random tangents.

"He does not clarify how to do the assignments unless you ask. Pay attention in class, even the details. The problem with his lecture is that he does not emphasize those little details and then he has them on the tests and quizzes. But you can find those information in the book. Read&pay attention then you won't complain about his class.",1.0
"What people have said on here is a bit unfair. He does try; it's the students who don't care. He is actually a nice person as long as you aren't rude.

I put a lot of effort into this class. I tried really hard. He did not seem to care that our class average for tests were 70%; he grades hard.

                      Assignments: Vague questions and harsh grading. Tests: Very poor description of what will be on the test and tests typically have things never gone over in class.

Unless you like the smell of burning coal and or fire crackers I would not suggest this class. Homeworks are long and seem fairly irrelevant to course work. Tons of writing for an engineering course.

"She is awesome! Literally the reason I majored in Psychology. She has a lot of energy and she's really funny. Slides are very thorough, but her tests were a bit hard. you definitely had to study for them because they are detailed. She gives quizzes and small writing assignments that sometimes felt like busy work but was manageable. She's great!",1.0

"Doesn't teach out of the textbook assigned, not to mention the textbook is horrible at showing steps and giving clear explanations for problems.  Usually gives quiz and  test questions that require a ""deeper understanding"" of the concepts of the chapter which aren't entirely covered in the homework.  However, he is an easy grader of homework.",0.0
"Tumanov quite simply cannot lecture. About halfway through the semester, I attended class but stopped paying attention. His accent makes him hard to understand not that without it, he'd be able to lecture well anyway. If you do the homework and study you will do well, but with a different prof, that level of work would be a letter grade higher.",0.0
"You don't learn much from Tumanov as his explanations aren't great and he has a hard to understand accent. In addition to this, the book isn't exactly all that clear either.

If you review the stuff after each class and make sure you get everything on the homework, then A is in your pocket.My little tip is: find an excellent study buddy!That helps me",1.0
"You get used to the accent but that doesn't help the fact that when you ask him questions he doesn't understand and answers something else.

"HORRIBLE professor. Most math professors here are bad but I've never been so confused in a subject like with him. lecture was pointless he just outlined the book, my ta was also bad and a hard grader. test averages have been ~65%, homework is ridiculous along with quizzes and the book does not help any, moral of the story FIND A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR",0.0
"Tumanov is your average UIUC math professor; and by average I mean bad at teaching, and foreign with a thick accent.

"Major beef is that he is extremely hard to understand. It honestly took me 3 weeks to get used to his accent. Meanwhile I had to study primarily from the book just to keep my head above water. He obviously knows his stuff, but teaches like he's the only one in the room, usually ignoring raised hands. Avoid if possible.",0.0

"Prof Fritzsche was the hardest lecturer I've ever had. He is nearly impossible to follow because his lectures are scripted and unnecessarily poetic during class. He talks very fast with a voice that is different than his conversational tone. He seems like a nice guy who is passionate about the material, but he makes it impossible to learn.",0.0
I thought Ralphie was bad and then I had Fritzsche. His lectures are extremely hard to follow and sound rehearsed--plus he sounds like he is preaching. He will never stay on a slide long enough for anyone to even read what is on it and he doesn't put slides online or tell you anything about what the midterm/final will be one. TA's are no help.,0.0
"I took this as my ""easy"" class and the workload was. However, sometimes the subject matter was very heavy (emotionally), but Fritzsche knows how to teach the intense subject matter. It's a very impersonal class and I doubt Fritzsche knew even 1 student;s name, but I recommend it anyways. A lot of mandatory reading.",1.0
Professor Fritzsche has a passion for teaching about the Holocaust. He often shares personal stories and gives insight on touchy subjects. The subject matter is not to be taken lightly. Some classes he has cried showing pictures. I can honestly say that I loved his lectures. He has a very dry sense of humor that is very funny if you can sense it.,1.0
He is very passionate about The Holocaust and gives his personal opinion every chance he gets. His lectures seem incredibly useless. The only thing that matters is reading the novels assigned and writing genuine papers. Seriously read. I didn't and I struggled big time. Discussions are kinda awkward but attendance is taken in discussion.,0.0
"He is a very good lecturer, makes the class interesting. However, besides that it really is your TA that does everything else. He can be slightly arrogant. The only thing that matters grade wise was discussion and the papers you had to write for the class. The midterm and final were also essays. Not hard to get and A or B in this class.",1.0
"Fritzsche knows his stuff.  Super smart.  A bit intimidating at first, but he'll work with you as long you're showing effort.  He's a got very dry wit - I think students don't realize he's joking sometimes. High standards for grading, heavy on writing/essays. He sets the bar high but it's totally worth it.",1.0
"This professor's lecture are extremely messy and hard to follow. He is overly dramatic and his lectures are overly rehearsed. He spends little to no time communicating with the TAs and has little to do with the exams. The class is essentially based on your TA, I'd avoid this guy if possible.",0.0

"Big lecture means it's all about the TA, since he'll probably never meet you. Depending on the TA, you can skip the endless (and lame) novels assigned.

"Some people just should NOT teach. This guy comes across as so smart and proud and doesn't try to explain things to his students.

If he were still at my school, I'd be taking one with him this semester.",1.0
He is very hard to understand and his lectures are very dry. He is fun however and that makes up for how terrible his daily quizzes and tests are.

                      Nazar was nice and the class was okay. She did take suggestions, but the problem is that it sometimes made it hard to know what SHE (really) wanted.

All I can say is if you some how end up with this guy as your professor you had better make good use of the tutors available and go talk to your TA every week during office hours.  If you cant put that much time into this class then you should probably switch to another section.  Probably one of the worst professors out there.,0.0

He did end up giving us ""Sample Problems"" though that were basically right from the test because people were doing so bad on tests.",0.0
"Oh Peter Loeb. This guy has a way of making you feel absolutely stupid for asking a question whether it pertained to math or not.

Professor Oikhberg is a nice guy and he means well but his lectures seemed to not communicate well with everyone. He also had problems answering most questions that were brought up during class.

The homework was very easy and the papers and exams were fair.  If you put forth a reasonable amount of time and effort you should do just fine.",1.0
"His lectures consist of cramming an hour and a half of information into a fifty minute class, and as a result he sped read most of the information, so it was slightly hard to take quality notes.

Kindratenko is kind and talks to you like you have never heard the material before. His lectures were chock-full of information that helped me get an A. He could've gone a little slower in the middle portion of the semester but pace was perfect otherwise.,1.0

"This class is difficult. It's definitely not impossible, but you're going to have to work for it. The homeworks are long and require a lot of independent learning. The labs are ok.

"Good class, it does gradually get harder but as long as you master the concepts and design process, still an easy A.

Her lectures are long and feel disorganized. TA's give their own presentations on some days which liven things up a bit. The grading process is very straightforward. Two midterms and a final.

Great teacher.  Take him if you're fulfilling the ADV COMP. Gen Ed ( and a double bonus because it covers the  literature and art requirement for LAS.)

Barrett was a nice guy. Class was pretty difficult. Definitely have to do the reading for it (and there's alot of reading).

Mimi is an amazing teacher I've taken three of her classes so far.,1.0
"Mimi is fantastic! She assigns a lot of dense reading (150 pages a week) but it's not necessarily dull and I got by several weeks not reading. Yes, she stutters but it's good because it gives you time to finish writing her sentence. She is extremely articulate and well-educated. Her job is to convey some abstract ideas, so the class could be tough.",1.0
"She is brilliant and engaging, and her perspective and insights are much needed here.  I found her to be very generous and helpful.  She changed my way of thinking, and helped me think in a more nuanced way.",1.0
"Mimi Nguyen is one of the BEST teachers I have EVER had. ive learned so much from her classes and i continue to think deeply about the themes. the fellow commenters here are out of hand, a blatant example of sexism and racism. dont take a class that requires attention, reading, and critical thought if you don't want that!",1.0
"I'm surprised there are so many negative reviews for Mimi Nguyen. I thought her class was fascinating, and her passion for the subject was highly evident. This class isn't an easy A by any means, but the instructor is highly accessible and willing to clear up any misconceptions you may have.",1.0
"Her lectures were really long and tedious, and it was difficult to follow along and take notes. She sometimes took weeks to post powerpoint slides, which makes it impossible to prepare for pop quizzes. Most of the readings were difficult, especially for a gen ed.  A lot of them had nothing to do with Asian American Pop Culture. Not what I expected.",0.0
"Maybe she is smart and well informed... but you can't understand much through her unique mixture of obscurantism and valley girl speak. And as another rater noted accurately, she tries to cow you into submission by saying that you as a student won't understand the readings. Ugh.... why would you ever assign this woman to teach ?",0.0
"This class showcases everything that is wrong with social study classes today. Hopefully you like watching Yeah Yeah Yeahs videos on YouTube as a means of gaining cultural awareness, because this class is chock-full of moments like that.

Over complicates everything...sometimes the point she is trying to prove isnt even that deep.,0.0
"B-o-r-i-n-g. On a physical level, but more importantly, on an intellectual level. It's hard to explain until you personally sit through the vacuum of relevant or coherent ideas that ebbs between Nguyen and her loyal TAs who wait strafing in the corners. Also- Nguyen's lack of fluent speech skills becomes incredibly tiresome within a few lectures.",0.0
"While she seems fun, bubbly & young,her teaching is poor. Assigns hard readings (50+ pg per class) and said she didn't expect us to understand them. I don't doubt that she's well educated, but her comments so confusing and long that you lose what the point was in the 1st place. Utterly distracted by her lack of speaking skills.""uh uh uhhh"".",0.0

Her counterculture/alternative tastes seep into almost everything she talks about... Regardless, an A is achievable if you have a brain in your head.",0.0

"I didn't go to class toward the end because I would just fall asleep.  Lectures were utterly boring.

Attendance isn't mandatory, but good luck on the exams if you don't go to class. The (timed essay) exams seem terrifying at first glance, but he told us explicitly what would be on them and graded fairly. Highly recommend!",1.0
"Senseney is an engaging and enthusiastic lecturer with lots of travel tips, but he dims the lights (causing sleep-deprived students to fall asleep).

I have absolutely no idea what's going on, and I've gotten straight A's in all of my previous arch history classes. This class is a triple threat of poorly taught, uninteresting, and difficult. Avoid if you can!",0.0

"This class was boring (B.O.R.I.N.G.). Its called architecture history, which we do learn, but that being said it should not have ben as difficult as it was.

"There's something of a cult following around Senseney as a lot of people really like him but there's a reason for that. He is extremely passionate about history and is always willing to share his experiences and knowledge with students. There's nothing tricky about the class, just pay attention in class and study.",1.0
"Great professor, very knowledgeable and passionate about material, which also means a bit difficult. he does not believe in taking attendance but you need to go to class, take notes, and study material weekly. his grading on our exams used a generous system that gave you the edge but still found the class difficult for a history class",1.0

No joke.",1.0

You can tell he's passionate about the topic.",1.0
"Completely loved him. He was very charming, sweet, and completely worthy of a hot pepper! (in that older man  kind of way) ;) His class was a joy to go to.

"Dr Axelson is an amazing professor! For Orgo 1 she makes it very clear what will appear on her exams, what to study, and gives optional practice worksheets, which I recommend doing to get an A.

"She made lecture interactive and interesting however, she always seemed to rush to get all of the material for lecture done on time. Tests were fair and as long as you studied the videos, it was very much doable especially since her lectures just reinforced what the videos taught. In her office hours, she seemed to care about her students learning.",1.0
Well in a word she's way too smart and expects other people to be very smart too.  You need to print out all the slides and fill them out with details in lecture. Attendance isn't mandatory but you're basically screwed if you don't show up to class.:) Very hard class and she said the average is gonna be curved to a C+ or B-. Be ready to put in 5/5,0.0

"David was great. He would let lectures get off topic to discuss random topics with students, bu he always went over every lecture slide. He goes through slides quickly, but they're available online. He's like a cute grandpa or something I love that man.",1.0
"I personally thought the lectures were boring, but Prof. Irwin did make jokes and give demonstrations in class about concepts that broke up some of the monotony. An interest subject matter if you can get yourself to sit down and read the 60+ pages of reading per chapter. Insanely hard tests (final avg was failing) but he curves generously.",1.0
"Weekly quizzes online boost your grade. Tests are lecture-based, so just go to class. He is boring but gets to the point. Tests are curved. Textbook is easy to read. Take this class if you're willing to put in the minimum amount of work.",1.0
HARDER THAN THE CLASS IT USED TO BE! He is a really nice guy but the class avg. on the tests are a D and tests are worth most of your grade. Lectures are pretty dry except for the few jokes he makes. Also he focuses mostly on the eye and not the other senses. If he doesn't bump everyone up a grade at the end of the semester I will be surprised.,0.0
"He was nice. Lectures are easy to understand, participation recommended, and DO read the textbook closely since the test is really a little hard. Fortunately there are practice tests and TAs are nice.",1.0
He is very nice. This class is an introductory so it has so many things to be covered. Go to his class to get the notes or get from your friends. Attendance is not necessary. His curving is generous. Three lab reports are annoying but first two are fun. The professor is caring and willing to answer questions.,1.0
"Long chapter readings, but if you can keep up with them, you'll be fine. Online quizzes and three tests. Attendance is required at lab but not at lecture. He was very monotone but did mention things at the lecture that were not on the powerpoint. Will post powerpoint after class. Go to office hours!",1.0
Still reaping the rewards from taking this class.  The professor is boring but nice.,1.0
"I thought this class was very easy. I barely had to attend class and when i did- the lectures were not that bad. The tests are not hard if you study the practice exams. Also, the top test grades count for 2/5 of the grade where the lowest only counts for 1/5. The class is also curved. So it was easy to get an A if you put in a little effort.",1.0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It is SO boring! It's pretty hard. Even though he gives you practice exams, the exams are terrible! I had to read every chapter and study for hours just for a B. Most other Psych classes aren't like that (and I've taken 9). He just stands up there and lectures in the same monotone voice every day- UGHH! I hated it!",0.0
"Lectures are as interesting as subject matter allows, and Irwin is about the nicest man you'd want to have a professor.  The grading, however, is very difficult.  Tests are too short (no room for error) and tend to draw from moderately obscure text passages.  If you can't attend all lectures and keep up with the readings religiously, skip it.",1.0
"Hardest, most boring class I've taken in college.  Tests are just like the practice tests so make sure to study those.  Only take this class if it's required!",1.0
"Very funny guy, the material is pretty boring but he tries to make it fun. Tests are good if you study. Overall an ok class.",1.0
"Very funny guy. Lectures aren't insanely interesting, but how interesting can rods and cones really be??? He seems to understand that the topic is only of mild interest, and tries to spice it up. Great teacher, even if the tests aren't easy, he grades on a curve to help the students out.",1.0
"Very enthusiastic about perception. He's funny and is sympathetic to student's needs (ie moving a test because of a basketball game). Gives breaks every class. Tests are hard, but review sessions by the ta are very helpful.",1.0
Really fun examples in lecture! Tests are ok. Definitely need to study. But he takes some test questions right off of quizzes on the textbook website and old sample exams he gives you!,1.0

                      really funny...gives breaks during class

"This class is very interesting but a lot of hard work. Do not slack off, he does not do the plus/minus grading scale, just solid A,B,C,D,F. Attendance gives bonus points and there is also a bonus long-term memory exam. Beware: Dr. Hough is very prone to tangents and is indecisive. Class was poorly organized, especially w/Open labs and clarity.",0.0
"You really do have to have an epiphany about this stuff or this course is going to be unnecessarily difficult. Get real, work hard. I bombed the first 2 exams because I underestimated the work. By the end I was a pro and you will be too. Med/Nursing/OT/PT/Pharm school is tough and if you can't handle this class don't even bother applying.",1.0
"The soon-to-retire Hough is an okay guy, but he can't for his own life stay germane to the topic and always goes on completely irrelevant tangents.  Easy to get an A with all the extra points. Syllabus is too verbose and is 50 pages.  Very disorganized fellow. The class is annoying and too much work but take it, it's easy to get a good grade.",0.0
"Dr.Hough is a real funny guy. He tells random stories in class. Lecture is extra credit. He comes off as condescending, but he is just trying to get his students to learn the material. He also gives an extra credit long term memory exam. Most of the class gets A and B. Don't do nething stupid and end up as  the subject of one of his random stories",0.0
Dr Hough is hilarious..he tells these stories that really have no point to them and laughs at himself for a while after. Hes awesome and a great teacher! He really makes the material more clear..but you have to go to the lecture to really understand it. Hes a little intimidating but really knowledgable. OKAAY! Its a miracle! NO ITS NOT! haha,1.0
"This class was an absolute nightmare, lectures are extra points so make sure you attend but reading on your own is the only way to understand anything. Unless you want to spend your weekends, (at least 7+ hrs) in open lab, I'd suggest NOT taking this class because you WILL NOT DO WELL!!",0.0
Dr. Hough is a great teacher and tries to make his class very fair for students. His stories are hilarious and makes attending lectures fun. This class is highly recommended for any pre-professional students and with enough effort you can easily achieve an A.,1.0
"Dr. Hough is a nice guy but a terrible teacher!  He is never clear and the notes are worse, but he gives you the old exams.  Study from those and go to open lab and you'll be fine.  Lecture attendance is extra credit, so go sign in and do a soduku or have someone sign you in.",0.0
Dr. Hough is extrememely knowledgeable and the lecture notes that he provides are straight to the point. Going to lab and open labs are a must. Dont think that you can get away with studying everything out of the Atlas alone.,1.0
He knows what he's talking about. Read the lecture notes before going to class so that going to class is a review. People who say that he can't teach go in expecting to be taught- Dr. Hough's lectures are meant to clarify and reiterate things from the book. The lecture notes themselves are well written and explain the material well.,1.0
"Hough is a great teacher. Go to open lab and you will be fine. Lecture exams are all true false questions so technically nobody should get below a 50%. You can usually do decent by studying some, but for the lab practicals, you must go to lab and study the terms.",1.0
"I dont recommend this class for Gen Ed, pick something easier.  But if its a requirement then prepare yourself.  Dont fall behind on the stuff cuz its harder to catch up.  Dr. Hough is HILARIOUS.... okay...... (u'll get it when u c him)  lol   anywho... try 2 go 2 class and try 2 sit in front so u wont fall asleep.",1.0
"DR. Hough is a genius and knows everything about human anatomy.  The class is difficult but if you can memorize a lot of stuff, you will easily get an A.  Most people get an A in the class.  I think you have to be a moron to get a C.  Dr. Hough is also very sarcastic and can be funny at times.  The key is to go to lab. Highly recommend the class.",1.0
He's kinda crazy.  I think he does have good knowledge of anatomy but he doesn't know how to teach very well or clearly.  You definently need to study and keep up with the material but if you go to class (you get extra credit) it's not terribly hard to get an A (about 40% get A's),0.0
"IT is a hard class, but their are plenty of opportunties for extra points here and there. Professor is kinda funny. Go to class, you get extra points. This course requires you to study ALOT.",1.0
"I don't care about fish and animals, this is a HUMAN anatomy class!",0.0
"
                      Although Dr. Hough knows what he's talking about, he doesn't know how to teach any of his material. Unless you can manage advanced biology material in a class with horrible instruction, don't even think about taking this class.

"David Prochaska is probably my favorite teacher in the History department at U of I from my 4 years in the department. I can see how he might have been a bit dull, but some of the most thought-provoking conversations I've had in the department were with him.",1.0
"I became so bored with one of his lectures that I decided to drop while in class.  He is a tough grader, an uninteresting lecturer, and I learned nothing from his course.  Also, used a horrible textbook (Adas Turbulent Europe or something) that was very expensive, despite low quality.",0.0
Worst guy ever. So boring. Dont sign up for his classes.,0.0
"I am a history major and this class is still unbearable. I really wish I could have dropped, but I was unable to. This prof seems to read off of his notes, is uninteresting, and spends way too much time talking about the assigned films. Worst prof I've had and worst class I've taken.",0.0
"HIST 259. Worst professor and class on campus. Required to watch numerous foreign films outside of class, so much reading for 200 level class. Grading and exam study guides are ridiculous. Prof. is arrogant and expects you to know everything he reads off his papers in class. Very unorganized. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0.0
So much writing and reading. It's like having 400 class instead of 200 class. Countless documents and journals to read.,0.0
"He basically reads off ""lecture notes"" that are more like written essays. Slides are very unorganizaed and verbose. He does not get to the point despite all the information he gives. He expects you to read from multiple text books and watch films outside of class. His attitude is some what arrogant. Very harsh grader. I dropped the class.",0.0
"I just dropped this class and I'm SO HAPPY. Unorganized lecture slides and boring lecture. We begged him for an exam study guide and he gave us 180 terms and 22 essay prompts, so he expects you to know everything he said plus the textbooks. The exam is tomorrow and I'm so glad I don't have to take it. Grading is 1/3 paper, 1/3 midterm and 1/3 final",0.0
"Class basically involved watching him read from his own notes for an hour and twenty minutes. Very difficult class to sit through, and it is sad because the content was interesting. Beware, this class meets an extra day of the week, monday nights we had to watch movies and were a huge part of your grade as you will see when the first test comes",0.0
"If you value your GPA, do not take a class with Prochaska.  He gave me the worst grade in my college career.  He is not clear on his requirements and grades harshly.  He held a grudge against me the entire semester and berated me in frontof the class.  My fellow classmates even sympathized on my behalf.  No one in this class or others likes him.",0.0
"Although he is a bit vague, he is an interesting professor.  He is helpful when you go in to talk with him.",1.0
I didn't know I was signing up for a film class.  His grading is extremely vague but at the same time nothing to really worry about.  I think he is kind of cocky and his wardrobe kind of speaks volume about his personality.,0.0
"He took an interesting class and made it terribly boring.  He gives a lot of busy work homework, particularly for a History class.  Pretty boring guy.",0.0
"What a disappointing class and professor. The class was a gigantic waste of time. It only met twice a week, and he only lectured once a week. The other times we watched movies. I didn't sign up for a film studies class. Got a B+, but wish I would have saved my time. Boring lecturer and speaker.",0.0

                      I don't recall signing up for a film class, but that's what I got. Absolutely ridiculous class. Midterm 'study guide' preposterous. He must have tenure. Arrogant, smug, not much actual teaching going on.

"I had a wonderful experience with professor Armstrong. For design studio, he gave great feedback to better my designs and always made rounds to everyone to check on their progress. He was super knowledgeable in architecture which only bettered my experience. Only negative is he can lecture for an hour before each class.",1.0
"the worst as program advisor. never reads/replies emails, never answers calls, and if you need a letter from him, you better write it yourself and make him sign it",1.0
"Professor Armstrong is by far the worst professor teaching in the Architecture school. I took Arch 171 in Fall 2005 and he hardly taught. He just said ""um"" a ton. He tried to fail everyone in my studio subsection because he thought we weren't ready for achitecture even though we had A's and B's on most of the projects. Overall, this guy is a loser.",0.0
"Gets a bad rap from younger students.  Definetly shouldn't be teaching fresh/soph level classes, but he is a very knowledgeable and capable graduate level professor",1.0

"Once he was giving a lecture on perspective drawings.  It was a slide show that lasted about an hour.  After the hour, he went back to about 1/3 of the way through the presentation, said ""just to recap"", and gave the same exact lecture again, for 40 minutes, on the same slides.  As an architecture student, the most sleep I got was during his class.",0.0

"pj is the most boring, impossible to understand **** that i have ever known. he grades sketchbooks using a simple drinking game called ""random sketchbook grade toss"" and also clearly has a relationship with his fellow professor, rusch. he is so boring that the only way one stays awake in his class is by counting his ""um's""...1436 in one semester",0.0
"excuse me while i shoot myself...good thing i fell asleep before i could.  this man could not be more boring.  he tries.  but he fails, and you know what he is just completely horrible when it comes to grading sketchbooks..and for that reason I HATE HIM",0.0
As others have said Prof. Armstrong is extremely boring. He does not explain what he wants draw or done clearly.  He wasn't actively involved in what we were drawing and never stoped by the studio unless he had to talk to the Ta's. He is a nice person and intelligent but very un organized and a horrid teacher.,0.0
"This is one of the only people I have met in my life whos voice truly puts people to sleep.  It's like being in front of a hypnotist.  Lectures are completely boring.  You Prof. Armstrong really cares about the subject, but he is definately not a teacher that inspires greatness in others.",0.0
"His lecture is absolutely boring. He could spend a full two hour lecture on how to draw the line using pen.... feel like dying. He didn't stop by studio much, which is a good thing. The other thing is that he never gives out the grade. You have no idea on how u are doing in that class... it could be very scary for students. Good luck for those...",1.0

I absolutely love her. She is one of the nicest most considerate professors at uiuc! She really loves teaching and she is one of those professors who likes to see you do well on exams instead of trying to trick you. All you have to do is memorize the study guide she gives you before her 3 exams and you will get an A! No final!,1.0
"GREAT CLASS! I had discovery course and was very interesting! I loved the teacher, and even though I didn't have to go, I went and it paid off on my exam grades- she gives you a study guide of what is exactly on the test! Such a easy class to take",1.0
so easy! loved this class!,1.0
Great class!,1.0
Easy A. I didn't go to class more than 6 times all semester and that includes 3 times to take the exam. Just have someone send you a study guide that's filled in and study it prior to the exam and you'll be fine. Easy easy class.,1.0
"HDFS 105 has been my favorite this semester. Like others have said, it's hard to do bad in this class (granted you study the material written in the study guide)! Exams are a cinch and only contain 35 questions each. Discussion is mandatory, but I found it fun as most of the time we just talked about the material covered in class that week. A+++",1.0
"If you look for easy ""A"", go ahead and take kelly's HDFS 105. You have to go to discussion session and strongly recommend to go to class because she covers everything that is on the exam. If you cannot get at least B or above, i suggest you to look for a job rather than being in college.",1.0
"This is class is VERY easy. If you study the materials that are written in the study guides, you're guaranteed an A.",1.0

Mark has been one of my favorite teachers that I've had in this university. As long as you skim the readings you should be good enough to participate a bit in class. He also is extremely helpful if you attend his office hours and he genuinely wants you to get a good grade. Definitely a friendly and chill guy. Loved having him as a teacher!,1.0
"He is a semi-enjoyable guy. He assigns a lot of reading homework through a course packet that you can't return. As long as you attend class and at least skim through the readings you will do well. The papers are difficult, but definitely do-able.",1.0
I loved his class!!! He is a great speaker who clearly is very knowledgable and loves what he teaches. I found his discussions really interesting and fun. He does a great job of getting students involved. I would highly recommend any of his Shakespeare classes because he knows and loves the topic.,1.0
"He's nice and helpful, but seems to show absolutely no emotion, and is very dry. The class is extremely boring and makes me want to gouge my eyes out. This takes something that is relatively easy and makes it unbearable. Avoid if possible.",1.0
"Dahlquist is a pretty good teacher. You can tell he knows a lot, and that makes discussions more interesting. However, class was boring for the most part. He grades papers pretty easy and almost never takes attendance.",1.0
"Dahlquist is a nice, friendly, and smart guy but his class is not easy. Going to class is a pain because we do the same thing over and over. He also gives out quizzes usually all clupped up at the end of the semester. not an easy A like other RHET classes.",1.0
"Dont buy the writing analytically book. Try to stay quiet in the class; he gives all of the quiet students A's. It is hard to get an A on an essay; the class is sometimes very boring since its 4 essays that make up 80% of the grade. He gives quizes!! other teachers dont! I wouldnt assume an easy A, but B is easy to get",1.0

Mark is a really nice guy but conducts a very boring class.  He is honestly a nice guy with an incredibly odd way of teaching but this class was entirely uninteresting to me despite my passion for the subject.  Mark does not captivate the students and did not make me want to attend class at all. Overall a good guy though.,0.0

"For a 100 level class, the material is very challenging. You have to stay on top of it all semester. 3 hour exams weren't bad, but the cumulative final was brutal & was worth 25% of your grade. Demarco was really good at explaining the material & enjoyed answering q's.  Much more interesting than 101, but prepare to spend lots of time studying.",1.0
"Do not expect this to be an easy class. The material is difficult and you go through a lot very quickly. But he is a good professor who takes his time to explain things. Go to every lecture, book is not necessary, and buy the slideshow packet; everything is in there and otherwise it's impossible to take notes. Really stay on top of this class.",1.0
Theres a reason why the former professor of this class gave extra credit like crazy. Its a very tough class for something thats supposed to be rudimentary physics for non-majors.

"ACCY304 is hard and boring anyway. Since it is required, all we can do is to pick one professor that is a nice person. Compared to another new professor for ACCY 304 in Spring semester, Wu is better because he is not strict at all. Wu is a really nice person. Although I almost never participate in the class, I got 90+ for attendance. Memory is key.",0.0
Professor Wu does not conduct class in the most interesting way but he does make the class very straightforward in terms of what will be on the exams.

"HE IS THE WORST PROFESSOR EVER! He doesn't genuinely want to help students learn or do better. He is very difficult to communicate with and acts selfishly towards his own interest which is research than spending time with students or teaching.

He is very passionate about teaching. Many of teh negative comments on here are there because the material is very intangible. Class is what you make of it.

Pretty much what people before said. He thinks that uploading lecture notes is our privilege not our right and tries to withhold them to force attendance.

He is hard to understand and overcomplicates simple things. It is truly amazing that I passed this class. I finished with a 44% and luckily everyone else did so bad that my final grade got curved to a 61% and barely passed. Steer clear of this class and TAKE AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE IF POSSIBLE,0.0

His lectures dont relate to what is going to be on the homework or quizzes.

Not so great.... The subject matter is difficult and it was my first time exposed to informatics. I'm not sure if he is just missing the fact the this is an INTRODUCTORY class.

Plant pathology can be deemed as interesting with Eastburn. Eastburn sets up this class for you to succeed. We have six in-class writings and three large papers.

This class is terrible!.....if you want to learn about old philosophers and their ideas then go ahead and take this class......other than that you write a lot of papers (all in which are graded extremely hard) and you have a final (also hard) worth 20% of your grade......I pretty much gave up when taking the final.....Not worth your time!,0.0
"She's so funny! She's really cool and makes class fun! She'll never shoot down your answer if you answer a question in class, so you never feel stupid. She's a good teacher too.

"Very interesting subject, do not need to buy textbook. Drops lowest grade out of three exams and two papers. Not hard to do well, but as a professor she is quite biased and could push some people's buttons. Let's her opinion affect the material to much, but doesn't interfere with grade.",1.0
She constantly talks about being a lawyer and teaches material on a bias.

She is clearly passionate about her work.  She makes the subject matter fun and interesting.  I recommend taking 449 with the lab because it makes understanding the material that much easier without a ton of extra work.  There is an independent research project for lab but it is completely manageable.,1.0
"What a brilliant professor! She's so amazing! I came to tell her this after class, and she said I made her day and then invited me to walk with her to her office. She researches Daphnia. She's such a personal and gifted professor. If only the chemistry department here were as friendly, clear, and amazing! She AND Marcot are wonderful!",1.0
Carla is a truly gifted professor. She cares so much about teaching in a real way. She'd let us use our notes AND the internet on exams because she says that in our career we will have those tools available and that is what she is training us for. Best Professor I've had. Go to office hours and you will earn excellent marks in her classes.,1.0

And she gives extra credit right before breaks...times when most people don't show up. But lecture extra-credits are only worth 1 point, not 2 like the tests. An easy A if you try.",1.0

"Great professor. His class is very easy and the exam is open book. However, unless you study and attend the classes you wont find the exam easy. Attendance is 10% but you get it if you bring articles to class. He may seem unorganized, and doesnt follow the textbook exactly so its hard to see which parts is he covering. No maths involved whatsoever",1.0

"Health Economics, he has a lot of experience in the field and a lot of valuable insight.  Tends to ramble and clear his throat a lot, but you don't need to be in class to do well on the exams if you're fine with reading the book.  Very generous with curves.",1.0
"I have to disagree with the other posts, hes decent guy and the class isnt difficult.  GO TO CLASS and you'll be fine.  Most of his test questions come from practice exams and the final was mostly all recycled questions.  His lectures are important and the book really isnt needed.",1.0

He is a very funny professor and knows his stuff. Quite understanding. The problem with the course is the weight of the exams for your overall grade. 3 midterms and the final.

"Prof Tzanetou is a great professor: she's very knowledgeable but also very friendly. She loves to interact with the class about both class-related and non-class-related matters.

She accompanies the textbook with A TON of supplemental articles that are tested on the midterm and final. The class is really not an easy gen ed course from all the annoying reading.,1.0
What a terrible professor. She doesn't care about students or their grades. Doesn't post up lectures on line so you have to take notes in class every time. Not a good speaker. Grade scale is unreal.

Her classes are pretty interesting and unlike some classes you get to learn a lot. there is no text book required for this course and all readings can be found on e-reserve. Her grading components are well distributed and provoke your thoughts and help you actually learn and critique what you are reading. Her grading is pretty fair too.,1.0
She is very enthusiastic about the class she teaches but it appears fake. She asks many elementary questions during the lecture that make you feel dumb sitting there because the questions are not worth asking. The lectures are easy but the tests are challenging. Show up to lecture; she takes pop attendance and also the powerpoints are incomplete,1.0
McLafferty is very kind and helpful. She truly loves her subject and tries to make it interesting. Tests are half writing and half multiple choice. Since there is no book for the course you have to pay extra attention in lecture. As a result the tests can be tricky if you did not take good notes. A fair and fairly easy class overall.,1.0
"Material is dry for the most part, after all it is stats. However it can be interesting at times. There's one homework assignment every week, which gets replaced by a big project at the end of the semester. Exams are tricky, but doable if you pay attention in class. McLafferty is a good professor, but I wouldn't recommend this specific class.",1.0

Do not take if you aren't very passionate about the subject!!!",0.0
"Don't take this class. Her slides make no sense, she takes daily attendance points, and her tests are just insane.

This class was super easy. It's a very easy way to get your science credit for those who are not STEM majors. Professor Kranz was awesome.,1.0
The exams often test very picky details and there are a lot of passage based questions. Wording of multiple choice makes it easy to miss if there's a slightest bit of doubt in your mind. Honestly this is one of the most relevant MCB courses I've taken. Lots of memorization in the first half. But also an emphasis on understanding.,1.0
"Kranz's exams feel like an all immunology version of the MCAT. Passage based questions. Stand alone questions. Emphasis on application. He puts ""More than one answer is true"", ""Both A and B"", ""None of the above"", etc as answer choices to see if you truly understand the material. There is a lot of detailed memorization as well. Not an easy class.",1.0
Kranz is a very engaged lecturer but loses focus on topics easily.  Tests are very difficult and questions are tricky/confusing. Overall a difficult course.,1.0
"I was in this Class Spring 2010. Professor Kranz is really interested in Immunology and he was lively and engaged at 9 in the morning. The Tests are really hard, but if you study directly off the lecture slides, you can get an A on the 4 lecture exams. Almost all exam material comes directly off lecture slides. Kranz is a nice guy, gives hard tests",1.0
"I took this class because I heard from fellow upper level MCB students that it was easy.  While the grading scale is generous, lecture is boring and tedious.  Kranz will start one thought without finishing another.  The class is interesting, but it takes a lot of self discipline to take the time out and study properly.",0.0

He's had a bunch of success in his professional career, but he's still as friendly, accessible and willing to help as can be to the undergrads who take his course, which is generally rare with professors that have had his level of success.

GREAT TEACHER AND CLASS. extremely helpful professor. highly recommend this class to any of you mcbers who are pre-med.  i have never learned so much about immunology.  he keeps the class interested with not only his humor but with random videos that have nothing to do with anything!  plus 40% receive As and 40% get Bs... not bad!  but study hard!,1.0

                      Damn good, only a bit to fanatical about antibody structure. Best MCB class ever! For once a teacher that won't bore you, and actually keep you awake (yes that is possible even for an MCB class).

"Sit for one of his ****, ****, elitist lectures and you almost forget how horrible his teaching is.  What I learned: his views on the causes of campus sexual assault (women in short skirts and boys being boys), how to pour a beer for a girl so as to make sexually assaulting her easier, and why ****s are destroying our country.

He acted as if he was too good to be teaching 150. Lecture was boring and hard to follow. tests were near impossible.,0.0
He sucked!!  Only ones who laughed at his jokes were HIM and maybe 1 or 2 other ignorant/lame people in the class.  Very hard and stupid class... bad teacher... get outta herr!,0.0
While he is humorous people tend to forget that his humor is based off ignorant remarks. For example he said   Are there any farmers in the room? (he sniffs around and someone raises their hand) then says  I knew I smelled them.,0.0

"I really like her. The class seems unorganized and doesn't flow very well but she has to teach the course manual. If you get lucky and end up in her section you will have fun, learn a lot, and probably get a fair grade.",1.0

                      Amazing teacher, really helpful and kind. Fair and unbiased grading. Must-take for CMN 111 and CMN 112

"Does not use book and everything he teaches comes from his notes, so attendance is a must. Very knowledgeable and a great teacher. Homework is impossible to do alone and group work is a must in order to pass class. Grades very nicely. Very helpful if you ask for it. Really challenges his students. Makes sure you learn a lot.",0.0
His lecture is super boring and you have to write everything he wrote on the board because there is no lecture notes or any other things u can use to study. HWs are super duper hard.,0.0
"Homeworks are hard but graded nicely. As long as you go to class and participate you will do fine but make sure you're not caught not paying attention because he will call you out and ask you questions specifically. ""Have you been reading your notes?""",1.0
The best professor!,1.0
"Amazing professor; don't let the sheer amount of work cloud your judgement. He prefers writing on the board old-school style. If you take good notes, you shouldn't need a textbook. But if you skip a single lecture, you will fall behind. He was very helpful in office hours (which you WILL need). Be ready to work hard and with other classmates.",1.0
"smart,clear and the best.",1.0
Awesome Professor. He'll work you hard but you learn an amazing amount.,1.0

                      Overall, a very nice guy. He definitely shows his interest in teaching the subject. The material can be hard at times, but he does his best to teach everything thoroughly. He is also very helpful in answering questions. Don't get the textbook though, the class is based entirely on notes taken in class (an incentive to attend).

literarily the best physics professor I ever had in terms of teaching.,1.0
Probably the best class that I have taken at UIUC so far.,1.0
"His lectures are organized but fast and mind stimulating -I found myself contemplating after most lectures. If one listens to the right thing, it can teach you a lot and it makes the reading easy afterwards. He motivates the new concepts very well and Prof Weaver has a good sense of humor and good personality. I found his notes extremely useful.",1.0
"Clearly excited about the material, and funny to boot",1.0
Professor Weaver is so fat the best physics professor I have ever known. He is humorous and dedicated to teaching. His exams are fair(average around 80). A good professor to take classes for.,1.0
One of the rare physics teachers who teaches you to THINK like a physicist.,1.0
"He is a kind and interesting guy. Although the course is relatively hard, his lecture is good. Homework is difficult sometimes, but is always interesting.",1.0

                      This man is amazing! Teaches you the most epic things from the ground up. Great notes, works hard to prepare for class. Goes well beyond what is expected, and is always willing to help. Makes the homework himself; it is always better than book problems, and prepares you for real-world physics. Brilliant.

"Yes Sally is very specific about the work you turn in and how she grades it, but that is typical at UIUC! She truly cares about her students and this class, which I haven't seen a lot with other professors here. If you attend class, have a good attitude, and do the work, you'll get a good grade!",1.0
"The professor is kind, but didn't learn much from the class. She wants to see creativity from the work and will give a low grade if it doesn't fit the grade rubric. The class material was easy and interesting.",0.0
Class is incredibly boring but you have to show up to receive points. Fridays class is an online third hour and very easy. If you do the assignments you basically automatically get points. I put very very little effort into the class and came out with an A.,0.0
"Easy class, didn't have to take final to get A. Just make sure you do your homework and go to class!",1.0
Class is boring. Discussion is a joke and a waste of time. The class is among the most boring I have taken at the U of I. The tests are too difficult and grading for assignments was unfair.,0.0
"Great class. Attendance is mandatory but you just do discussions. She gives you tons of opportunities to get points. Written exams with about 4 questions, I received As on all of them with hardly any studying. Just understand the concepts by watching the lectures and you'll do great.",1.0
Not a bad class - boring but not hard to get an A in!,1.0

                      Lecture is very boring, and it makes no sense to attend them. The exams are semi-difficult and the content is presented in a very uninteresting way.

My favorite professor. Such a good teacher.,1.0
"This course has 4 different teachers that change every few weeks, which is very unsettling. They're all knowledgeable, but not all good teachers. Dr. Baillargeon is very difficult to listen to, and the exam on the material she taught is the one I did the worst on. The exams require quite a bit of studying, and there's not really a study guide",0.0
"Dr. Baillargeon is amazing! She is elegant and beautiful, she explains things very clearly. Her powerpoint is well-organized. She has done so many research and some of them are used by the textbook! I like her so much",1.0
She's really sweet. And she's done amazing research. I feel ridiculously fortunate to have had her as a professor. Class is not difficult. Show up to class with lecture slides printed out and write down any extra information she may say. That's all you have to do. I got over 100 in the class because it was so easy. Tests are all multiple choice.,1.0
"Taking Dr. Baillargeon's class was a pleasure. Lectures are clear and concise, and exams are straightforward (although you'll definitely need to study). Pro tip: attendance isn't mandatory, but sometimes on days when few people show up she will give a hint about an exam question. Really a brilliant lady and a very interesting course.",1.0
Renee is a great psychologist and professor. She is very enthusiastic about what she teaches and studies. She is definitely a leader in her field and is highly respected. Be grateful to learn from her. I loved this class.,1.0
"She's so cute! Her lectures are full of videos which make them very interesting. She explains everything slowly and clearly so basically you dont even have to read the textbook. Everything is well-organized. Super nice and experienced ! P/S: she says ""thank you"" in a very cute way with a  very strong Quebec accent. It's a must to listen to that!",1.0

Has a rigid outline of textbook examples and often makes mistakes. He doesn't properly prepare you for the midterms or finals. There is no review and he tells you to look at the textbook instead of explaining it to you. The website he uses has simplified problems that aren't representative of the test material.,0.0
Dude was nice but a horrible teacher. Read off a paper and didn't make sense. Hard class without any previous linear algebra experience. MAKE SURE HE GRADES YOUR EXAMS CORRECTLY. I'm still concerned he gave me an incorrect grade for the final exam. stain,0.0
He's really a good instructor and I don't get why he's rated so poorly on this website. Maybe he's too slow when talking but the main point is that he really elaborates everything explicitly! Love him!,1.0
the way he would explain things just never clicked,0.0
"Makes mistakes on examples a lot, and is not the most clear while explaining but he is a good guy and tries to help.  When the board has hard to read he bought a special eraser and chalk so it was more visible and he always asks if there are any questions.",1.0
He was often a couple minutes late to lecture and frequently made mistakes while doing examples. After a couple lectures more than half of the students stopped going to lecture. I kept going to watch him bomb twice a week in the hopes that we would offer those who tried hints on the exam. He did not. I'm really upset that I chose him for this class,0.0
"Your grade depends on the class average so he doesn't really use the usual grading scale. His lectures are really confusing, two weeks into the class everyone stopped showing up. He makes countless mistakes during lectures which is really confusing, arrives late to exams and can't even follow his own notes, copies em wrong on board. DO NOT TAKE",0.0

                      Explains slowly and clearly most of the time. If it's unclear, he will be more than willing to help. I missed class and he gave me his notes for class that day.

Hard topic if you don't have math background. Gardoni's explanations are very good and make the material look easy and intuitive. He grabs your attention with his explanations and can be very funny.,1.0
"One of the hardest courses I've ever taken. A good background in mathematics and statistics is necessary. Textbook wasn't mandatory but did help. Weekly homework took forever and was doable with help from a great TA. Exams were difficult, but the final grades were definitely well curved. Overall a useful course for any profession.",1.0
"For how dry the material is, Paolo is pretty funny. Topics are hard to grasp at first, and the midterm was much more difficult than the final. Homeworks are difficult, and long, and there is hw every... single... week... Do the extra credit, because it will save you.",1.0
"A great professor, he is ready to answer to your queries. Although he is a very busy guy in reaearch, he still pays a lot of attention to his class and encourages students to come forward and discuss problems. Even thougb the material  is difficult, the mid term is easy. But expect to put a lot of egfort in the term paper.",1.0
